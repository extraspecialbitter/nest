<i>The Haiku Apprentice</i> is the joyous story of an American diplomat&#8217;s journey
into the realm of haiku while living in Japan.  More than that, it is an
account of spiritual and political self-scrutiny.  I find it easy to enter
Abigail Friedman&#8217;s world.  This may be partly because I am a woman, but more so
because she is a marvelous narrator.  Friedman's descriptions are vibrant,
while her down-to-earth wit spices the narrative, which is consistently
intelligent and sharp.
</p>
<p>
This writer is careful not to leave linguistic stumbling blocks.  She opens
doors for less experienced readers, with lucid explanations of Japanese words,
pronunciations, and traditions.  As Friedman describes her haiku education
under the tutelage of Kuroda Momoko, one of Japan&#8217;s most esteemed haiku
masters, readers will surely find it impossible not to learn along with her.
Every haiku student should read her discussions of <i>kigo</i> and Zen.  She features
contextually relevant haiku throughout, including some written by her fellow
poets in Japan and a few by the author.  Her translations of well-known haiku
by the Old Masters invite readers to rediscover their timeless appeal.  When
seen again through Friedman's eyes, long-familiar poems are newly inspiring.
</p>
<p>
After the author joins a haiku group, she shares a new awareness regarding
haiku poets:
</p>
<p><blockquote>
Perhaps all these people had discovered something I was just now learning;
that survival in an increasingly complex world requires each of us to tend to
our souls, our individuality, more than ever.  I needed to nurture my ability
to see the world as I saw it, not as others might see it.
</blockquote></p>
<p>
Abigail Friedman ends the story of her haiku quest with perhaps her most
important insights:</p>
<p><blockquote>
My new name was a reminder to me that haiku is not just about writing about
beauty, but is a path of self-discovery.  I could not expect to write good
haiku if I was not seeking to be true to myself.
</blockquote></p>
<p>
This book is delightfully accessible, regardless of the reader's experience
(or lack of it) with poetry or Japanese language and culture.  I recommend <i>The
Haiku Apprentice</i>, not only to haiku aficionados, but also to anyone who enjoys
a good read.
