			Thank you for your support of The Heron&#039;s Nest! Along with the December 2002 issue comes your opportunity to participate in the Reader&#039;s Choice voting for favorite poems in Volume IV. You are invited to vote for up to ten poems (in your order of preference) published in The Heron&#039;s Nest during 2002. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The global haiku community continues to expand, and as it does, our views of what constitute the best in haiku evolve. We encourage you to make your influence felt by taking time to vote for your favorite poems in Volume IV of The Heron&#039;s Nest, poems that you feel are most representative of the best haiku presently being written in English. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The Valentine Awards issue will be posted and mailed in mid February, 2003. As with all other issues of The Heron's Nest, this awards issue will be sent to the <a href="http://www.adianta.com/archives/">American Haiku Archives</a> at the California State Library in Sacramento, and to the Museum of Haiku Literature in Tokyo. Notification of the Valentine Awards winners will be sent to major haiku organizations and independent journals for announcement as permitted. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Editors' Award</strong> 
			<br>
				Three haiku, a Grand Prize and two Honorable Mentions, will be chosen by the editors to receive awards as the best in Volume IV of The Heron's Nest. The poet selected to receive The Grand Prize will receive a marble plaque upon which his or her name and haiku have been inscribed. The poets of the two Honorable Mentions will receive Certificates of Award. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Readers' Award</strong> 
				<br>
					A marble plaque will also be sent to the poet whose haiku receives the most votes from the readers. The final Heron's Nest for 2002 (Volume IV) is this December issue, so voting can begin immediately. All haiku appearing in the <a href="thn_va.index.04.html">past twelve issues</a> are eligible. However, <b>you cannot vote for your own haiku</b>.
