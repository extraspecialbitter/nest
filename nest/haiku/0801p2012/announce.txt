Dear Friends, Readers, and Heron's Nest contributors,

The March issue of The Nest (the first of Volume VIII) is now available 
for your reading pleasure at <http://www.theheronsnest.com/>.  As always, 
earlier issues are accessible as well; from the home page simply click on 
"Volume Contents" to read any of the thousands of haiku that have graced 
our pages over the past six years plus.

Please remember that March 15 is the deadline for submissions to the
June issue of The Heron's Nest. As always, we look forward to receiving
your inspired moments!
