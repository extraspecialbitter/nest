Dear Boston,

Here is the September issue. I would still like to hear from Spike - about the final edit in his essay and about whether he would like to add something to his memorial for Robert Major. But the vast bulk of this text has been finalized - perhaps all of it in the end, and I’d like to give you as early a start as possible.

As ever, I’ve used the double dashes to indicate em dashes.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Ben

PS There's a picture of Robert Major at the beginning of his memorial section. Let me know if there's any problem with that coming through.

COMMENTARY



       One of the joys of haiku is the opportunity to share a “now moment of awareness” of a poet whose poem springs from a present-minded encounter with circumstances different from our own. Good readers are willing to engage a poem in an imaginative encounter. Thus, when poetic craft shapes the unfolding of an experience, both the event that sparked the poem and the event's relationship to the universe become accessible even to readers of different backgrounds. My personal experience with snow and snowmen has been infrequent to say the least, but from my first encounter with this fine haiku by Mark Arvid White to my many happy reunions with it since, I find myself watching, along with him, in quiet awe.

       Consistent with the disorientation one might experience in a heavy snowstorm, there is no guidance from punctuation in the poem, though I feel a natural pause at the end of line one.  (Perhaps there once was an ellipsis but it’s been covered by the snow?)  The lulling sound of the double l’s in line one and the soft vowel sound that ends lines one and three convey a feeling of deep silence and tranquility that encourages contemplation and meditation.

       Though the poem is only nine words long, “snow” appears three times, once in each line.  Repetition of this degree is unusual in English language haiku but here it effectively expresses the relentless nature of the snowfall and the ubiquitous nature of the snow at that moment.          

       Like autumn's scarecrow the snowman is a fascinating creature.  At birth our proud creation, fussed over, adorned, posed with, he is soon abandoned.  He endures his moment of celebrity and his all too brief life with  acceptance and equanimity very few humans could muster, but the fate of this snowman is quite different from that of the famous “Frosty” or all the snowmen I knew.

       In Haiku World: An International Poetry Almanac (1)  William J. Higginson writes that the Japanese term for snowman is literally translated “snow- Daruma” or “snow-Bodhidharma” after the First Patriarch of Zen, or sometimes “snow-Buddha.”  He attributes this to the round shape both the snowman and certain representations of the monk and Buddha have in common.  White’s poem gives us deeper similarities as well.  Not melted by rain and sun, but sitting silently, this snowman resumes his original nature.

       As do all fine haiku, the poem’s simple, objectively depicted images,  through the poet’s skillful expression, resonate with the deepest experiences of our existence.  On behalf of the other editors and all our readers I thank Mark Arvid White for this wonderful poem.  

                                                                       Robert Gilliland

ROBERT MAJOR
August 9, 1920 – May 18, 2008







On the Other Side: In Memory of Bob Major
by Michael Dylan Welch

 
Robert Major was for nearly two decades one of the leading and more distinctive haiku poets in the Pacific Northwest. He wrote mostly in a 5-7-5 pattern, though not slavishly, and paid close attention to having clear and immediate images, often with a seasonal reference and a two-part structure. His haiku were frequently infused with a subjective touch, or sly and sometimes self-deprecating observations.

At the Basho Bash in Portland, Oregon, I asked Bob to sign my haiku autograph book, for which I ask poets to write one or more of their best or favourite haiku. Here are the two poems Bob wrote for me on May 11, 1996:

Before turning in
we step off the cabin porch
to check on the stars

Peering in the door,
a mirror reflects my face
among the antiques

The preceding poem exhibits a playful sense of humour, as does the following verse from his first chapbook, Shadows on the Shoji:

First trip to Japan.
We find the Japanese crows
all speaking English

Whether he wrote with humour or with a light seriousness, Bob's fulsome style and honest or playful depictions of nature and his small-town surroundings won him admiration and respect. 

Bob had a long and, I believe, rewarding life, and many of us in the Pacific Northwest were fortunate to know him. Despite his long life, though, perhaps his life and all of our lives are like the shadows on the shoji screen in the title poem of his 1997 chapbook:

For a little while,
our shadows on the shoji
as the candles flame

Here's a poem of mine in remembrance of Bob:

spring's deepening green--
beside the silent heron
our long shadows touch

----------

I am saddened to learn of Bob's passing. I've long enjoyed his poetry and got to meet him at the Haiku North America conference in Evanston, Illinois in 1999. I still remember that he wrote a haiku back then about how, under fluorescent lights, bald heads all gleam differently. Bob had a wonderful, self-effacing humor, perfect for haiku, and a big, generous heart. 

—Robert Gilliland

-----------

the lilacs

bloom in great profusion. Robert would have loved the vibrancy of colors and scents that decorate us this year. It was a cold spell that turned our yards, our gardens, our spring into a kaleidoscope of beauty. And it was in this cold spell that we discovered the truth of all life . . . to every thing there is a season.

The following poem was the result of a moment I shared with Bob on the first day I met him. It was written during a ginko at the Bloedel Estate on Bainbridge Island.

woodland path—
a small flower
bends our knees

I loved Bob's wisdom and quick wit. In an on-the-spot response to one of my poems he wrote:

sitting in the swing
to remember how it was . . .
what to do with my legs

Bob was a dear friend and I will miss him very much.

rows of folding chairs . . .
memories of him circle
within the silence

I have fond memories of Bob. He always seemed to have a twinkle in his eye, and he gave good bear hugs. He was especially kind to me at the time of the HNA meeting in Portland, where he functioned as my chauffeur in addition to everything else he was doing for the local group. While I have been thinking about Bob, I remembered how impressed I always was about his attention to and fascination with small happenings and objects.

So large a presence
yet his delight in small things
"a pinch or a smidgen"

At my first Haiku Northwest meeting, early in 1999, poets sat in a circle around Francine Porad’s living room reading haiku. When my turn came I read the first line of my offering and paused. Just then Bob, who was sitting beside me, let loose a thunderous sneeze. I jumped and my mind went blank. Francine couldn’t suppress a giggle, which, of course, was contagious. Soon we were all laughing, even Bob. He was both notorious and beloved for such sneezes. Strange, but even that sound plays a part in my missing him.

I especially appreciated the Quaker memorial service arranged for Bob. It took place in an old meeting hall that seemed to be steeped in the shared insights of countless Friends meetings. The appreciative and respectful silence embraced us, significantly intensifying a sense of the space once occupied by our dear friend. Voices blossomed from that silence, clear, heartfelt, and filled with emotion. Bob’s family stood to share their memories, one after another, each of them vivacious and entertaining even in their obvious grief. More than a few folks spoke of or recited haiku. Being there was rather like being transported back in time. I felt adrift in a hallowed place, one in which both the absence and presence of Bob were tangible and in perfect balance.

yet the clock in the Friends hall
keeps time

Beach cottage bedroom . . .
waiting for the beam of light
to sweep the room again

reading by lamplight;
sounds of a summer night
press against the screen

the flute’s first notes . . .
three lavender petals fall
from the arrangement

Pumpkin carving . . .
a ring of grinning faces
around the table

two red cedars
joined in their early years—
grown apart with age

Eighty-five years old . . .
what is one to do with
all these memories?

reaching a wide stream . . .
the trail continues
on the other side
