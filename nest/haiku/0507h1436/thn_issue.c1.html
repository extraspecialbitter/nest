            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              Allen McGill </p>
            <p>Allen McGill has crafted a haiku that resonates well beyond the 
              duration of its brief eight words. The opening line instantly invokes 
              the image of an ominous sky. In just two words we have all the information 
              we need to begin to paint a picture in our minds&#8217; eye. Then 
              our attention is directed downward, to where we can see the effect 
              of the clouds on the ground below: shadow meets earth. Finally, 
              the image is put into context when we learn that these events are 
              unfolding in farm country.</p>
            <p>The haiku suddenly takes on a human face. The ground darkened by 
              passing clouds is the source of someone&#8217;s livelihood. The 
              clouds, in turn, are either harbingers of life-giving rain or a 
              cruel joke of nature. Such is the dependence of the hard-working 
              farmer on things that are beyond his or her own control.</p>
            <p>I must mention that I see another possible reading of this haiku, 
              one that hinges on the word &#8220;darkens.&#8221; Had storm clouds 
              merely passed over the valley, as they undoubtedly did long before 
              farmers sought to cultivate it, they would have warranted little 
              notice. The clouds, however, cause one farm to darken after another, 
              leaving us to wonder: precisely what are these clouds? </p>
            <p>In the U.S., the past century has seen a continuous flow of population 
              from farms to urban centers. Those who remain to work the fields 
              face fierce international competition and sagging prices. Often 
              they must struggle to keep land that has passed from generation 
              to generation. 
            By extension, clouds in the form of foreclosure have appeared over 
              farm by farm, with little sign of daylight. Brought on by drought, 
              clouds in the form of dust covered the U.S Midwest during the Great 
              Depression.
            Clouds in the form of pesticide-resistent insects threaten farms 
              continually. Allen may not have intended any of these tangents, 
              but his haiku is an easy harvest for the fertile imagination.
            Such is the richness of a great haiku. </p>
<p>Allen McGill&#8217;s words 
              are seeds that germinate and quickly grow in many directions, providing 
              sustenance to all who partake of them, as well as comforting shade 
              to all who pass on by.</p>
