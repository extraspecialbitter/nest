Hey there 3B,

Now here's the REST of the story! The July Nest in it's entirety.
Kinda in a hurrry or I'd be a bit more gabby. And the Mariner's
lost 2 out of 3 to the lowly Padres. Sheesh! On Friday they lost
a 3 - 0 lead to a grand salame with 2 outs in the bottom of the 9th.
Gaaaaak!

COMMENTARY

Allen McGill has crafted a haiku that resonates well beyond the duration

of its brief eight words. The opening line instantly invokes the image
of
an ominous sky. In just two words we have all the information we need to
begin to paint a picture in our minds' eye. Then, our attention is
directed downward, where we can see the effect of the clouds on the
ground below: shadow meets earth. Finally, the image is put into context
when we learn that these events are unfolding in farm country.

The haiku suddenly takes on a human face. The ground darkened by passing
clouds is the source of someone's livelihood.The clouds, in turn, are
either harbingers of life-giving rain or a cruel joke of nature. Such is
the dependence of the hard-working farmer on things that are beyond his
or her own control.

I must mention that I see another possible reading of this haiku, one
that hinges on the word "darkens." Had storm clouds merely passed over
the valley, as they undoubtedly did long before farmers sought to
cultivate it, they would have warranted little notice. The clouds,
however, cause one farm to darken after another, leaving one to wonder:
precisely what are these clouds?

In the U.S., the past century has seen a continuous flow of population
from farms to urban centers. Those who remain to work the fields face
fierce international competition and sagging prices. Often they must
struggle to keep land that has passed from generation to generation.

By extension, clouds in the form of foreclosure have appeared over farm
by farm, with little sign of daylight. Brought on by drought, clouds in
the form of dust covered the U.S Midwest during the Great Depression.

Clouds in the form of pesticide-resistent insects threaten farms
continually. Allen may not have intended any of these tangents, but
his haiku is an easy harvest for the fertile imagination.

Such is the richness of a great haiku. Allen McGill's words are seeds
that germinate and quickly grow in many directions, providing sustenance
to all who partake of them, as well as comforting shade to all who pass
on by.
