OVERVIEW

Before addressing the Valentine Awards, I want to thank you all for so 
generously supporting The Heron^Òs Nest. You have responded 
enthusiastically to all of our efforts to  provide you with the best 
possible journal of haiku. I can^Òt tell you how many absolutely 
wonderful letters we^Òve received. A lot! You^Òve uplifted us, given us 
energy and confidence, and helped us to improve. You^Òve subscribed to 
the printed edition of The Heron^Òs Nest, made donations to help us 
defray costs and purchased gift subscriptions. But above all, you have 
submitted many of your finest insightful haiku. Thank you! 2004 was a 
whirlwind year for The Heron^Òs Nest. With our readership rapidly 
growing and the number of contributors also rapidly increasing, we have 
been obliged to make changes. We are now a quarterly, on-line journal 
available also in an annual hard copy edition. I^Òm happy to report that 
the transition has been going smoothly. We are delighted, no, amazed, 
and profoundly grateful for your support during this time of 
transformation.

And now to the awards! A record number of voters (78) participated in 
the Valentine Awards voting this time around. We are impressed that so 
many of you found time to revisit and select your favorite poems, 
especially during the busy month of December.

There are three prime purposes for our publishing an annual awards 
issue. First and foremost, we wish to honor poets who have gifted 
Heron^Òs Nest readers with exceptionally powerful work. The second 
purpose is to provide our readers with an opportunity to help shape the 
evolution of haiku beyond  any individual publishing efforts. Haiku 
voted to be favorites by peers serve as examples to help guide poets 
and editors alike. The third purpose for the awards has to do with the 
process of voting. Many of you commented that the careful reviewing of 
a given volume of The Heron^Òs Nest (with an intention to select 
favorite haiku) inevitably results in valuable insights to the craft. 
Clarity is acquired concerning what is and what is not valued. There is 
also a special pleasure in reviewing the past year^Òs poems. Someone 
said that it^Òs like revisiting old friends.

During  2004 we received in excess of 12,000 poems. We chose 593 of 
them to publish in 11 regular issues. They were written by 173 poets 
living in 18 countries. One in every four poets was new to The Heron^Òs 
Nest this year.

A few months ago, we Nest editors decided to add a new twist to the 
annual awards. Beginning with this year^Òs issue, the poet whose haiku 
is elected ^ÓFavorite Poem of The Year^Ô will be invited to write 
something about their award-winning haiku. Lenard D. Moore is the first 
poet to do this. He is also the first poet in Nest  history to sweep 
all three award categories. Lenard graciously accepted our invitation 
to write something (if he wished to) about his winning poem, penned in 
the wake of his family^Òs unthinkable tragedy. You^Òll find ^ÓThe Way it 
Happened^Ô on page 9. Ferris Gilli expresses perfectly what we are 
feeling in response to what Lenard wrote: ^ÓThis essay demonstrates the 
power of a man^Òs faith, and his understanding and acceptance of the 
place in the universe each of us is allotted.^Ô

A number of you sent comments along with your votes. Some concerned the 
process of voting, others the poems chosen. Some of you commented on 
both. ^ÓVoters^Ò Notes^Ô was a well-received feature in the awards issue 
last year so we^Òre including it again this year. The notes will be 
separated into two parts, one part about the voting process, the other 
about particular poems. The latter are included only if the poems 
commented on ranked high among your favorites. When at the end of this 
year it comes time to vote for poems in Volume VII, we^Òll encourage you 
to include comments with your votes so that we can expand these two 
valuable sections.

We Nest editors work very closely as a team, striving to choose work 
that will further both haiku and haiku poet. We value the contributions 
of everyone who has appeared in The Heron^Òs Nest and encourage those 
who are seeking acceptance to continue honing their craft. Those of you 
who have work in this Valentine Awards issue have achieved something 
extra special. It is a pleasure to honor you.

READERS' COMMENTS ABOUT VOTING

I keep a list of favorite Nest haiku going all year. All I have to do 
is look it over, along with the December issue, in order to put my 
Valentine selections together. If I don't do it right away, I might let 
it go and not get around to it at all. What a treat to read them all 
again. Fun! ^×Katherine Cudney

As in the prior two years, this was an instructive exercise for me. I 
started with a short-list of 67 haiku and fairly quickly winnowed those 
down to 19 finalists. Arriving at the last ten was more difficult and 
rank ordering them was the toughest task of all. But in the process I 
learned more about the qualities I respond to, and admire, in haiku. 
^×Scott Mason

My top ten list doesn^Òt feel all that definitive, objectively or 
subjectively, but at any rate here are ten pieces that resonated for me 
over the course of 2004. Thanks for another year of exceptional haiku 
moments. ^×Christopher Patchel

How great it was to see the editors in the last monthly edition of 
Heron^Òs Nest. You must do that more often. Now, to the Valentine^Òs 
voting. What a task! And how interesting to discover that I chose only 
two that had been editors^Ò choices^×maybe a cultural gap (references to 
the natural world that mean nothing to me here on the other side of the 
world) caused that or maybe I^Òm just contrary! I found myself mentally 
editing some as I went, including my own, I hasten to add. Going back 
through a year^Òs worth of haiku by some excellent writers is, however, 
not a chore. A bit like Santa, I^Òve made a list and I^Òve checked it 
twice (actually, more like five times, and with plenty of crossing out 
and moving round, and asking non-haiku members of the household what 
they think, and getting into some good discussions). I^Òm still not sure 
I^Òve got it in the right order past the first three! Still, all judging 
of writing is subjective, especially when it's already been through a 
rigorous editorial selection process. ^×Sandra Simpson

Once again, an impossible task! On another day I might have chosen 
others. But I have gone over and over them, and I like all 10 of these 
very much. It wasn^Òt until I had made my final selections that I 
realized there were only eight poets represented (i.e., I chose two 
poems each from two of the poets). ^×Carolyn Hall

Once again, much fun, but also difficulty this year in sorting them. I 
tried to rank them like any other haiku, on a 1 - 10 scale, but found I 
had too many that were 8s and 9s. A testament, as I always say, to the 
strength of the journal. ^×paul m.

As usual, these were selected blind from a short list of about 50 of my 
top-scoring haiku throughout the year, which I re-scored. My 
overwhelming impression was that all 50 haiku were very close in 
quality, so my final ranking 1-10 is virtually meaningless. Any one of 
the 50 was virtually interchangeable with any other in terms of overall 
merit. ^×Charles Trumbull

As usual, I found that I needn^Òt worry about selecting quality work 
from The Heron^Òs Nest, there being nothing else. But this year I felt a 
twinge of guilt about passing over so many really good poems, the 
products of so much skill and desire to communicate. As in the past, 
what I have selected is not so much ^Óthe best^Ô as it is the poems that 
happen to connect most strongly to my own experiences and to my own 
preferences regarding how haiku can be a unique, and needed, 
alternative poetry for me. ^×John Stevenson

My top ten for 2004 from The Heron's Nest. And a week before 
Christmas^×shouldn't I still be decorating or shopping? ^×Gary Hotham

I ran through all the issues from last year and noted 30 poems that 
resonated particularly well with me. It was very difficult to cut that 
number down to 10 and then put them in any meaningful order. There were 
simply too many strong poems to choose from. Though the Rick Tarquinio 
poem clearly struck me as the best of the lot, I can^Òt help but feel 
that most of the rest of the selections and the order of preference 
I^Òve put them in are somewhat arbitrary. ^×Timothy Hawkes

I have been putting this off because I know how hard it is and am 
afraid of giving a worthy poem short shrift! And then I learn again 
that this voting leads to double and triple enjoyment of  many, many 
wonderful verses. Thank you, all. Can you believe I have actually been 
taking a copy into the bathtub with me?! ^×Kirsty Karkow

This is my first year of voting and even though I want to comment on 
each of  these choices, I feel myself as a toddler amongst so many 
beautiful poets. ^×Robert Bauer

It was extremely tough this year . . . tough every year. There are so 
many wonderful poems! Very difficult to trim it to a top ten.^×Curtis 
Dunlap

These poems were among the 25 that I selected on a first, anonymous 
reading just for this purpose, intending to cast my votes for my ten 
favorite haiku appearing in last year^Òs The Heron^Òs Nest. Of the eleven 
2004 issues of The Heron^Òs Nest, I read eight in hard copy and three on 
the web. I typed the 25 haiku into a file, printed them out on paper 
for further review. When I went through trying to reduce the number to 
ten, I picked those that I knew would stay with me, possibly for years. 
I could only cut the list down to eleven, which I again printed out and 
read through several times with the names of the authors covered 
According to the rules of the readers^Ò selections, I was supposed to 
put ten of them in rank order. I figured that number eleven would drop 
out. But there was no way I could rank or grade them. Each of the 
following eleven haiku is simply sui generis. That is, each is uniquely 
itself, not comparable to any other, and therefore not possible to rank 
or grade relative to any other. ^×William J. Higginson

What a wonderful excursion it has been going through some extremely 
fine work in the 2004 issues. ^×Billie Wilson

As always, it has been a pleasure to review these. Also a neat way to 
keep up with the progress of new poets. ^×Cindy Zackowitz

In the first list, there were many poems. My selection of ten from this 
list was based on the different moods and feelings the poems evoked in 
me. At this point in my life, I consider these moods and feelings very 
important. The order of preference is based on the state of my mind 
now. If I were to go through the poems again in the future, I may 
rearrange them. In other words, I like all the tens poems! ^×K. Ramesh

A characteristic special to haiku, for me, is that I can reread them 
and find something new every time I immerse myself in one. ^×Maria Steyn

Thank you and everyone involved for putting together another wonderful 
year of The Heron^Òs Nest. There are individual monthly issues that I 
could easily (and did!) pick ten favorites from, so to cull only ten 
from the year is nearly impossible. For the sake of simply enjoying 
participation, I will give you a rather spontaneous ten from those I 
delighted in most. ^×Tom Clausen

This never gets any easier, does it? Thanks again for the opportunity 
to choose nearly half of the haiku that touched me so this year. 
^×Jennie Townsend

Choosing what I considered the ten best haiku from The Heron^Òs Nest  
'04 was, as others have said, very challenging, but also very rewarding 
and an education. I come out of this exercise knowing better what I 
value in haiku. My preference has always been for work with depth, by 
which I mean haiku which defy but also incorporate conscious 
understanding, haiku which one does not merely ^Óget^Ô and pass on from, 
but which invite entrance^×(because they are entrancing)^×a sense, 
bolstered by the senses, that they are alive, and will behave 
differently in different lights, to different eyes. For me, good haiku 
embody intelligence^×of head, or heart, or music. The best embody all 
three. Looking over those I have chosen, I find a quality of movement 
within stillness which may be another way of saying they are imbued 
with mystery, of being known and unknowable at the same time. They 
have, many of them, an aura of having just been born, and of continual 
birth, which means, of course, that they face, as every moment does, 
death at every moment. ^×Peter Yovu

SPECIAL MENTIONS

Even though they didn^Òt receive awards, a number of poems scored well 
above the average  and some poets accumulated high overall point scores 
for the their respective bodies of work. A few of these most popular 
poems received comments from the voters who favored them. All of the 
following poems resonated powerfully with readers and richly deserve to 
be part of this Valentine Awards issue. They are divided into two 
sections. The first section is comprised of poems that received 
comments, the second of poems without comments.

Special Mentions Pt. I

leaves on the river^×
too old to call myself
orphan
Peter Yovu

For whatever reasons this resonates strongly for me, along with some of 
his other haiku, bringing Peter^Òs name to the fore this year. 
^×Christopher Patchel



i turn the radio lower
       & lower
	    the summer stars
vincent tripi

You are not alone^Åthe space and brilliance above is also within. 
Beautiful. ^×Rick Tarquinio

Less attention to the media sharpens the senses. But so does fine 
tuning the soul^Òs receiver. ^×Peter Yovu



cloudless sky
the baaing
of penned sheep
Carolyn Hall

Deceptively simple, it doesn^Òt pull in a lot of extra images that might 
blur the contrast between the main ones^×wide open, and caged. Great 
stuff. ^×Rick Tarquinio



winter rain
the shape of shoulder blades
through her shaw
Yvonne Cabalona

The sharpness of a winter rain, the sharpness of the shoulder blades of 
a frail older woman, the edge of a year^×all these things come together 
to enhance each other. What a haiku should do.  ^×paul m.


			
graveside
my father and I
find common ground
Tom Painting

Just the right scent of mystery to compliment this graveyard setting. 
^×Michael Evans



near dark^×
the grand hotel drips
long after the rain
Gary Hotham

I^Òm not a city person and yet this poem almost makes me want to go 
there. I don^Òt think I^Òve ever seen a ^Ógrand hotel^Ô in a haiku before 
and the impending darkness and rain dripping long after it has stopped 
is very captivating. It sounds beautiful too, every word leading to the 
next and finally disappearing into the image. ^×Rick Tarquinio

Why do I feel the presence of thousands of dreams, longings and 
heartaches in those raindrops? ^×Peter Yovu



my daughter skips off^×
in a drying clam shell
a color I couldn^Òt name
Peter Yovu

We never know when the question will come at us, or how, or in whose 
mouth. But we probably don^Òt know the answer anyway, and anyway the 
question will skip away, to change shape and ^Ómeaning^Ô in a mercurial 
moment. Meanwhile, we^Òre left there with an old question, drying out 
even as we admit our failure. The daughter who skips away will probably 
never stop asking the question, and even when it seems like we know the 
answer, we won^Òt. Oh for that moment when we too can skip away from all 
questions and answers.
^×William J. Higginson



midsummer sun
facing the mountain
I^Òll never climb
Pamela Miller Ness

What makes this poem for me is the word ^Ñfacing.^Ò Any other choice: 
standing beneath, looking at, watching, driving past^×and it falls flat. 
Facing gives this poem courage, humbleness, and an acceptance of our 
mortality, frailty and predicament here on earth. There are so many 
mountains I^Òll never climb. This is terrific and I will carry it with 
me when I need to do some facing of my own. ^×Rick Tarquinio



the heat
two boys take it
outside
Paul Pfleuger, Jr.

An easy favorite, and perhaps the one time that I agree with the panel 
on the editor^Òs choice. A strong poem that Paul Mena summed up well in 
his commentary. We all know what ^Óit^Ô means, and I love the idea of a 
poem being about something without saying it. Haiku should employ 
common language, or in this case a colloquialism. A rather risky poem, 
that borders on gimmick, but pays off! ^×paul m



snowstorm over
my grandson puts a seed
in my hand
June Moreau

Last year^Òs seed, the hope of next year^Òs crop. No strain or stress 
here, no fireworks or bells ringing, just the direct action of a child: 
Here, Grandma, plant this one. Yes, the snow is out there, but spring 
will come. How simply our dealings in the world of vegetables and 
flowers mirror our own situation. May we all live in a world where such 
revelation is possible.  ^×William J. Higginson



winter dusk
the bare shoulders
of the prostitute
Yvonne Cabalona

This mix of coldness and humanity stayed with me. ^×Christopher Patchel



just as I decide
what kind of bird it is^×
its call
Cindy Zackowitz

Speaks well to our need to name and  identify things. ^×paul m



miles of beach . . .
the sudden urge
to run
Connie Donleycott

I can not step onto a beach without feeling suddenly free^×and always, I 
have this urge to run. ^×Michael Evans

Inwardly and outwardly this poem is huge. I have had miles of beach all 
to myself, know well the ^Ñurge,^Ò and have often given in. Sometimes I 
am running towards, sometimes away from, but it matters not because 
beach and urge aren^Òt going anywhere. I love this and I think I^Òll 
think of it every time I walk the beach.
^×Rick Tarquinio



just as I decide
what kind of bird it is^×
its call
Cindy Zackowitz

Speaks well to our need to name and  identify things. ^×paul m.
