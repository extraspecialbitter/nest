Hello There Boston Baked Bird,

Looks like our Sox and Mariners have slumped out of contention
this year. Sigh . . .

On an UP note, here is the October THN. It's ready to snug into
your mirror site so everyone can peruse it for glitches. Hopefully
it's very close to perfect.

Let me know if you run into any difficulties so I can try to help
out.

Hope things are going smoothly for you m'friend.

Onward!

Christopher

I'll attach the document as well. Don't know what's easier for you.

                        Hilary Tann


                COMMENTARY

Spring snow has a specific character. It is often
unwelcome, this late arriver. Especially as part of a
storm, spring snow evokes human feelings of impatience
for winter to end. This kind of snow can be a very
wet, sticky substance, and the flakes are sometimes
huge. As it falls, it can be difficult to see through
and is hard to clean off things like glasses or car
windshields. Such snow is fleeting, however, and
usually gone with the next sun.

Hilary Tann has made a brief haiku that is neither
terse nor insufficient. Arranged carefully, each of
the five key words gives the reader a complex image.
The writer has shaped the delivery of the poem^Òs music
with skill. An auditory effect, the lengthy "O" sound
of "snow," creates a pause. A moderate tempo is
achieved with the second line that leads smoothly to
the one-word third. The same effect, open-mouthed
without finality, comes with the sound of the last
word, "steams." Not many single words can carry the
weight of a line of haiku. As a verb, and in this
context, this one is successful.

Two modified nouns are presented before the verb, yet
there is action inherent in "snow," "pile," and even
"compost." Apposition of snow with steaming compost
reveals the poet's affect and her skill in expressing
it effortlessly, unadorned with ego.

The snow may have been falling as this haiku was
experienced. My own reaction is that it snowed
overnight, and that snow and steam were seen the next
morning. In either case, this mention of snow calls
to mind the swirling pattern of descending flakes. The
motion of the steam is obvious. What comes to me
with a bit of reflection is the reason for the steam.
Active composting occurs when plant material is being
eaten by many kinds of worms, insects, and small
things. When a pile is hot, when it can steam in cold
conditions, it is the work of bacteria. Farmers have
learned not to pile new-mown hay, but to leave it
spread on the field until it decomposes some. Given
the right air and moisture, a large stack or barnful
of such hay could burst into flames. Hilary^Òs compost
was mounded deliberately to increase heat and
encourage rotting. The labor has been done to collect
and pile weeds, leaves, and plant trimmings to ready a
spring garden and to enrich its soil later on. The
microorganisms are also hard at work on the provident
feast. Perhaps the gardener, holding to artificial
calendar notions, has tried to hurry spring. I can
envision colorful seed catalogues spread on a desk.
The order envelopes may have already been addressed
and licked.

The moment of this haiku, so keenly felt by the poet,
is that precise part of seasonal change when both
spring and winter hold sway.
