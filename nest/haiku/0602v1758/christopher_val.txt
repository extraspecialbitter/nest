Punchy lovingly presents you with the results of the Valentine Awards for
Volume V!

*******************

First the juicy bits: the winners and runners-up.
Next a proposal for two additional features (to be prepared by me)
Then my suggestions on divvying up the commentaries.
And last, some statistical stuff of possible interest.
* If you can receive a MicroSoft Excel document, I'd be happy to send
the whole voting spreadsheet. It's very interesting. So many angles to
consider.

NEW FEATURE PROPOSALS

I'd like to include a few quotes from our voting readers. Primarily
these quotes have to do with the voting process. In particular, Anna
Tamobour sent a really good letter that exemplifies what most readers
experience while selecting their favorite poems. In her letter she
reverently mentions some poems that she ended up not picking. I suggest
reprinting part of her letter along with some short quotes of other
poets.
This could accomplished either as part of the Overveiw, or I could create
a new double-page section called "Readers' Comments" or some such
title. Personally, I think this would make a fine new feature for the
Valentine Awards, but I'm not sure that I have enough quotes that it
would stand on it's own yet as a "section." Maybe a sub-heading within
the Overview. I wouldn't know until I've had time to get into the
writing and overall organization of this edition.

* I've already asked a few of the poets who sent interesting notes if I
could quote them in the awards issue and they've all agreed. I DID make
it clear to them that I might NOT use any quotations so that they
wouldn't be disappointed if we shelve this feature.

A second idea I have for the awards issue is to include some of the
voting statistics on a separate, loose page--only the top ten, or top ten
percent of poets in several categories. The paper edition awards issue is
already designed to be one sheet (4 pages) longer than the monthly
editions and therefore increases postage an increment. The extra,
seperate page would probably not increase postage cost any further. I
think there are a lot of readers who would be interested in these
statistics. I know I am. I see this sheet serving to honor poets who did
very well but didn't quite make it into the winners' circles. That is
also, by the way, one function of the "Special Mention" section at the
end of the issue.

Maybe I'm wrong about this. I'm just not sure. Take a look below at the
statistics I'd like to include (below) and let me know what you think.
There is a group of poets, about 10 percent or so, who play a major role
in shaping the personality of THN. They are regular contributors,
included often, and have appeal strongly to our overall readership. It
would be nice to acknowledge their contribution to our success.

If we all like one or both of these ideas for the awards issue, it'll
mean some extra work on my part to put it all together and make it fit. 
I^Òd be very happy to do this but I'd need a little extra help in the
area of commentary writing.  More explanation in the next section.

COMMENTARY ASSIGNMENTS

The only duplicate in this year's awards is Timothy Hawkes's "faint
stars . . ."
It's our EC first runner-up and was voted 3rd runner-up by our readers.
That means that we really have 11 essays to write instead of 12.

If we go with the idea(s) above, here's what I think would be a good way
to proceed. The four of us editors would each have one of the longer
writing pieces and one or two of the shorter ones. I've already got the
Overview AND I'll also be writing the commentary for the March issue.
So, y'all, I've already had a wonderful telephone conversation with Fig
today and she's agreed to help me out by taking on the "slave
cemetery" commentary--our Editors' Grand Prize. I simply didn't have
the time to get started on it anyway. That being the case, here's how
the writing assignments look in terms of length of essay:

Tif:  one long one short
Fig:  one long one short
Tako: one long one short
Punchy: Overview (long) two short
B3: two short

If this is agreeable to you then here is my proposal for the actual
assignments.

****************

For our own information:

If poets qualify in 3 of the 4 following categories, it seems to me that
they are major contributors to THN (the top 10%) and that their voices
are major factors in THN's popularity and overall personality.

1  Have at least one poem in at least five issues
2  Have garnered at least 50 points from voters
3  At least 50% of their poems received a vote from readers
4  Ten or more readers voted for their poems

These things form my basis for deciding upon poems for the "Special
Mention"
section and would also form the parameters for compiling a statistics
sheet.

*********
Issue popularity (number of votes for poems in each issue)

July (83) and November (82) had the most poems to receive votes.
January (45) had the least number of poems to receive votes.
64 votes for poems was the average of the 12 issues.
