            Deathbed . . .<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my old friend&#8217;s imitation<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of 
            a firefly<br>
            <br>
            The effectiveness of this wonderful haiku begins with the starkness 
            and immediacy of the raw emotion it evokes&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;the imminent 
            death of an old friend. vincent tripi&#8217;s use of the single word 
            &#8220;deathbed&#8221; demands the reader&#8217;s attention and reflection, 
            capturing the most basic human frailty and leaving us to contemplate 
            all of its implications. <br>
            <br>
            We are not left in this state for long, however. The haiku strengthens 
            and deepens by providing a simple but vivid reminder of the brevity 
            of life. This reminder comes in the form of a firefly, whose care-free 
            floating through summer breezes belies its short lifespan. How very 
            much like our own experience this is&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;a balmy night 
            of flutter and flash, seemingly timeless, but over much too soon. 
            <br>
            <br>
            It is this very analogy that completes the haiku, the realization 
            that our own existence, so full of cares and worries, is nonetheless 
            fleeting, and in that sense is not at all unlike that of a firefly. 
            <br>
            <br>
            vincent tripi&#8217;s use of the word &#8220;imitation&#8221; is intriguing 
            in that the dying friend is most likely not trying to consciously 
            mimic a firefly. Instead, this imitation occurred in the mind of the 
            author, who, in gazing at his friend, drifted back to a moment long 
            ago, a seemingly endless summer night. Like the flashing of a firefly, 
            however, this moment, too is short-lived, leaving only the resonating 
            words of this sad and lovely haiku. <br>

            storm clouds<br>
            the valley darkens<br>
            farm by farm <br>
            <br>
            It has been claimed that many of the stones in walls built by the 
            Incas were made to fit so perfectly that it is impossible to wedge 
            a razor blade between them. The same could be said about the words 
            of this haiku. Allen McGill could not have expressed his experience 
            more simply or more effectively. The surface images are perfectly 
            clear and yet there is ample room for readers to delve deeper. The 
            juxtaposition of storm clouds to farms gives rise to several interesting 
            associative meanings. In his July commentary, Paul David Mena pointed 
            to a few of those associations. There may well be others; it is up 
            to us to find our own. <br>
            <br>
            Impending disaster is implied by those heavy clouds. Soon there could 
            be flooding, loss of crops, loss of buildings, even loss of life. 
            The foreboding is tangible and this feeling can be projected to include 
            other current events as well: political, martial, economic, or domestic. 
            <br>
            <br>
            There is something more basic to this poem, however, than sharp imagery 
            and a variety of meanings. I am first and foremost struck by its emotional 
            intensity, its quality of ominousness. The storm has not yet struck. 
            The shadows of massive, cumulo-nimbus clouds are gliding into the 
            valley. There&#8217;s no time to waste. The livestock must be gathered, 
            pets brought inside, windows shuttered, and doors secured. <br>
            <br>
            Editors and readers alike agree that this is a haiku of remarkable 
            power. <br>

            <p>snowy night<br>
              sometimes you can&#8217;t be<br>
              quiet enough <br>
              <br>
              It&#8217;s nearly midnight. My wife and I are in bed reading our 
              books. All at once, something about the silence causes me to turn 
              to look at her. Eyelids drooping, she&#8217;s falling asleep. <br>
              <br>
              In the morning, I&#8217;m the first one to the meditation room. 
              I settle on my cushion and wait. It seems I&#8217;ll be sitting 
              alone today so, at the appointed time, I ring the bell. A minute 
              or two later the door opens. Someone crosses the room and sits down. 
              Then it&#8217;s quiet again, but there&#8217;s a distinct change 
              in the nature of the silence. <br>
              <br>
              I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve been in a large hall filled with people 
              who are not speaking, a candlelight vigil maybe, or perhaps outside, 
              for a funeral committal, or a moment of silence at a ball game. 
              Imagine how different those silences are. How many qualities of 
              silence are there? <br>
              <br>
              Night has fallen and the surrounding world is slowing down, drawing 
              inward. Snow begins to fall . . . Can you feel the change, even 
              in the silence itself? Yes! As it accumulates, snow becomes a muffler, 
              softening and calming the rough-edged world. It was at such a time 
              John Stevenson was moved to stop what he was doing to listen. When 
              he resumed his activities, even the slightest sounds appeared harsh 
              in contrast to the deepening drift of silence. John is a natural-born 
              poet, a haiku poet. It would be impossible for him not to seek words 
              to express wonderment at such a subtle but perceptible change. John 
              did find the words and we would be hard pressed to find others that 
              come close to matching the way he conveys this special experience. 
              The syntax is not typical of haiku. The tone, so casual that it 
              almost comes across as an after-thought, a scribbled a note, is 
              quite a contrast to the moment of awe described. That this is so 
              illustrates the great skill with which John Stevenson writes. His 
              down-to-earth use of language puts us at ease and welcomes us to 
              share his experiences. And now, I too am moved to a respectful 
              silence.<br><br>
