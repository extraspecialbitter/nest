            I&#8217;ll begin by restating what I&#8217;ve said in previous years, 
            that there are three prime purposes for our annual Valentine Awards. 
            The first is to honor poets who have gifted <em>Heron&#8217;s Nest</em> 
            readers with exceptionally powerful work. The images, moods, and emotions 
            in their haiku continue to resonate long after reading them. The second 
            purpose is to provide an opportunity to help shape the evolution of 
            haiku beyond individual publishing efforts. Poems voted to be favorites 
            serve as guiding lights for poets and editors alike. Haiku included 
            in the Valentine Awards issue exemplify qualities that are generally 
            held by our readers to be the most desirable. The third purpose goes 
            along with the second. A careful review of a given volume of <em>The 
            Heron&#8217;s Nest</em> (with the intention of selecting favorite 
            haiku) produces valuable insights to the craft. </p> 
            <p> All year long we receive poems from around the world. We probably 
              read close to 13,000 poems during 2003, but seriously considered 
              only about one in twenty. Of those 3,000 or so true contenders, 
              we accepted about one in five. Of the 636 poems in Volume V, 54% 
              received at least one vote. These figures are presented in order 
              to illustrate a point. We feel that all poems that have been accepted 
              into <em>The Heron&#8217;s Nest</em> are praiseworthy. </p>
            <p> The editors chose 36 poems (three per month) to be Editors&#8217; 
              Choices. That&#8217;s only one quarter of one percent of the approximately 
              13,000 poems submitted to us. Of those 36, the twelve <em>Heron&#8217;s 
              Nest</em> Award poems constitute one tenth of one percent of all 
              poems submitted. Amazing odds! Again this year, the results of Valentine 
              Award voting clearly affirm that readers and editors agree in feeling 
              that certain poems stand out from the rest! We are happy to tell 
              you that, of the twelve <em>Heron&#8217;s Nest</em> Award winners, 
              eleven were voted into the top twelve places. </p>
            <p> <em>The Heron&#8217;s Nest</em> continues to consist of a healthy 
              balance between poets from North America and those from other parts 
              of the world. Volume V includes work from poets who live in 28 countries 
              and in 33 of the states within the United States. We are also pleased 
              with the balance of new voices to those of long-time contributors. 
              Of the 166 poets represented in 2003, 30% of them were new to <em>The 
              Heron&#8217;s Nest</em>. It is also a great pleasure to share for 
              the first time the voices of ten poets who have been writing for 
              many years and whose names are familiar to many of us. </p>
            <p>
Far more voters turned out for the fifth annual Valentine Awards than
ever before. We thank all of you who took the time to select your
favorite poems. Choosing only ten from 636 is a difficult challenge.
Fortunately it appears to have been a richly rewarding process as well.
Along with poems selected, many of you sent comments about your voting
experiences. We very much appreciate such responses and have decided,
with permission, to share some of them. You&#8217;ll find &#8220;Notes from Voters&#8221;
at <a href="http://www.haikupoet.com/nest/haiku/0602v1758/thn_va.c8.html">http://www.haikupoet.com/nest/haiku/0602v1758/thn_va.c8.html</a>.
</p><p>
We value the contributions of everyone who has appeared in <em>The Heron&#8217;s
Nest</em> and thoroughly enjoy corresponding with you, encouraging you, and
learning from you. You have shared with us a wealth of deeply resonant
moments, expressed with great skill. Thank you for giving us the
opportunity to share your haiku with the world. Those of you who appear
in the Valentine Awards issue have achieved something extra special. It
is a great pleasure to honor you.
