            The Valentine awards is really an excellent idea, making a reader 
            go through all the haiku of the preceding year, shifting and considering 
            and perhaps finding more depth than at the first reading. 
            <dd>&#8212;&nbsp;Florence Vilen</dd>
            <br>
            <br>
            What a great idea to encourage thoughtful reading! Ranking the poems 
            is a critical step. It is a different process than the initial selection 
            of poems. It requires you to ask yourself what matters most; what 
            makes a poem stronger, in your estimation, and what weakens it.

            It is one of the highlights each year to do this-enjoy again each 
            pleasing page of each Nest, and then try to narrow my favorites, and 
            then to somehow put them into an order of preference. 
            <dd>&#8212;&nbsp;Billie Wilson</dd>
            <br>
            <br>
            What a difficult task it is to select just ten! Fun though, and it 
            certainly focuses one&#8217;s thinking. 
            <dd>&#8212;&nbsp;Sandra Simpson</dd>
            <br>
            <br>
            As always, a wonderful exercise! How often do any of us pull down 
            old issues of any other haiku periodical except in such an instance? 
            There is so much fresh, exciting poetry, that I tend to always be 
            looking forward. Or if I do look back, it is through a collection 
            such as The Haiku Anthology or an individual collection. So I thank 
            you for the exercise. 
            <dd>&#8212;&nbsp;paul m.</dd>
            <br>
            <br>
            I take the voting very seriously. I certainly enjoy re-reading all 
            of the poems.

            It was most gratifying to reread all the 2003 haiku published in <em>The 
            Heron&#8217;s Nest</em>, and as always, very, very difficult to choose 
            only ten. My shortlist was much longer than that! 
            <dd>&#8212;&nbsp;Maria Steyn</dd>
            <br>
            <br>
            I can&#8217;t tell you how much trouble I had this year. There were 
            some terrific haiku I hated to let go. 
            <dd>&#8212;&nbsp;Marian Olson</dd>
            <br>
            <br>
            It has been very hard to select only ten poems; there are so many 
            other great poems published in <em>The Heron&#8217;s Nest</em> too (in fact, 
            I didn&#8217;t find one I don&#8217;t like!). 
            <dd>&#8212;&nbsp;Dietmar Tauchner</dd>
            <br>
            <br>
            Well, if I needed (and I didn&#8217;t) something to help me appreciate 
            the incredible task you and your fellow editors perform each month 
            this was it. Had you given me twenty votes I would still be agonizing 
            over the many favorites I&#8217;d have to leave out of the winners 
            of my &#8220;Damn, I wish I&#8217;d written that!&#8221; awards. Many 
            thanks, again, to all of you for making this task so difficult. 
            <dd>&#8212;&nbsp;Robert Gilliland</dd>
            <br>
            <br>
            I reevaluated&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;blind&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;my top 230 haiku from the year, 
            came up with a shortlist of about 30, and winnowed from there. When 
            I revealed the authors&#8217; names to myself, I was surprised (pleasantly). 
            <dd>&#8212;&nbsp;Charles Trumbull</dd>
            <br>
            <br>
            Hardest job I ever did! How to choose from so many winners? 
            <dd>&#8212;&nbsp;Mary Lee McClure</dd>
            <br>
            <br>
            It was my time to stop and smell the roses, and I enjoyed each poem. 
            Some of them even triggered poems of my own. Amazing how that happens. 
            <dd>&#8212;&nbsp;Yvonne Cabalona</dd>
            <br>
            <br>
            How do I vote? Way too many great poems to choose from. Thank you 
            so very much for dealing out the opportunity to not just push these 
            poems aside, but to revisit them again and again. 
            <dd>&#8212;&nbsp;Alice Frampton</dd>
            <br>
            <br>
            Why did I think it would be easier this year? 
            <dd>&#8212;&nbsp;Barry George</dd>
            <br>
            <br>
            I must have made a zillion lists of favorites, and still felt that 
            I left ones out that should be in. John Stevenson&#8217;s beautiful 
            snow silence, and the delightfully evocative country diner. They went 
            in and out, in and out. Another one that I had go in and out, as it 
            really hit me as one of the most unexpected, original, and non-snooty, 
            was Emily Romano&#8217;s painted toenails lure a turtle. I loved it! 
            So unselfconscious, too, in a medium that she could have felt that 
            she should not show her bighairness, if you know what I mean. It proved 
            to me the essence of what I love about haiku as it should be&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;that 
            it is for real people, and about the real world. There were others, 
            too. Kylan Jones-Huffman&#8217;s gaunt children selling old bayonets. 
            It went from three to out numerous times. Of course, I will never 
            forget it, and only wish more people could be touched by this, rather 
            than the next distraction: Michael Jackson&#8217;s nose yesterday, 
            the moon today. Kay Anderson&#8217;s mama pitting cherries with a 
            paperclip--such a warm picture of a world that I always think must 
            be gone, yet still lives somewhere. Fay Aoyagi&#8217;s trenchant incomplete 
            resume. Summer afternoon with boys telling stories about &#8220;someday&#8221;&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;wonderful 
            from Jennie Townsend! Paul Pfleuger&#8217;s spot-on black ice. I thought 
            it was a perfect poem. Such a perfect observation. Then I was drawn 
            to Allen McGill&#8217;s deaf dog, at which I actually cried, not because 
            the dog is unhappy, but because of the closeness that was so beautiful 
            there. Maria Steyn (who is one of my favorite poets) wrote about something 
            my cat used to love to do: check out what everyone else is eating 
            and doing. Emily Romano&#8217;s pregnant cat left behind haunts me 
            just as it haunted her. Matt Morden&#8217;s winter sickness was really 
            a milestone poem of great power. Claire Gallagher&#8217;s &#8220;losing 
            the stars I know to the skyful&#8221;&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;such truth 
            there. Then there was that wonderful cherry blossom in the baby&#8217;s 
            diaper, found by Michael Meyerhofer. Well, those weren&#8217;t the 
            only ones. Every one of those went into the top ten. And yet none 
            of them are among the ten that I sent to you. In the end, I tried 
            to pick the ones that were the freshest, not meaning most original. 
            Gary Warner&#8217;s peanut-cracking kindergartners would have made 
            the top three if that were the only criterion. I did enjoy that one 
            mightily but chose ones that really stuck with me and had surprising 
            qualities of understated power. It took several weeks again, to finally 
            say to myself that this particular list that I sent was the one I 
            wanted to send. But the thing is, congratulations for making it so 
            bloody hard to do it!

            Are you tired yet, of hearing how hard it is to choose just ten of 
            the poems published in <em>The Heron&#8217;s Nest</em> in 2003? But it is, 
            incredibly so!
