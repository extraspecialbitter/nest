&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;buffalo bones<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a wind less than a whisper<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the summer grass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            Chad Lee Robinson</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Now <i>this</i> is a deceptively quiet haiku. Entering it, my breathing
slows and then, with little more than a whisper, Chad Lee Robinson
ferries me back in time to two far-flung locales, North America&#8217;s 
Great Plains and the small town of Hiraizumi in the province of Iwate
in Japan. In these places, I overlook three diverse cultures: European, 
Native American, and Japanese, and I become witness to two horrific events: 
the massacre of buffalo in the United States during the 1870s and &#8217;80s, 
and a tragic event that followed the historic battle of Koromogawa in Japan, 
which occurred on June 13, 1189. The key to envisioning these
events is yet another alluded-to moment that took place in the year
1689, when Matsuo Basho penned a haiku that was destined to become
one of his classics. All of these times, events, places, and cultures
can be discovered in this one exquisite haiku of just twelve words.
</p>
<p>
The opening line, &#8220;buffalo bones,&#8221; places me on a midwestern
prairie. I am struck by the tranquility of this expansive landscape,
and I imagine the vast herds that once peacefully grazed there. But
then, as I stand above the weathered bones of a buffalo, half-hidden
among the tall summer grasses, my imagination conjures a railroad
stretching east and west as far as the eye can see. A train enters my
restful reverie. It is packed with U. S. soldiers and pioneers,
mostly of European ancestry. All at once, I see rifles thrust from
open windows and puffs of smoke issuing from the long barrels. I hear
the screams of the terrified bison and the thunder of their hooves as
they stampede away from the train. The scene brings tears to my eyes.
</p>
<p>
The wholesale slaughter of buffalo was a plan conceived by American
colonists whose intent was to deprive First Nation Peoples of their
primary source of food. The resultant butchery later came to be known
as the Great Buffalo Massacre. It was so successful that by 1889 an
estimated population of some 75 million was reduced to a mere 540.
The prairies were veritably littered with their bones.
</p>
<p>
While &#8220;buffalo bones&#8221; is the primary means of alluding to the Great
Buffalo Massacre, it is through the words of Robinson&#8217;s second
allusive image, &#8220;summer grass,&#8221; that the power of the first
allusion is increased exponentially. The same words (actually a compound 
Japanese word translated with grass in the plural) were used by Matsuo Basho 
in 1689. Basho had tears in his eyes when he wrote:
<blockquote>
Summer grasses,<br>
all that remains<br>
of soldiers&#8217; dreams.&nbsp;<sup><font size=-2>1</font></sup>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
One of the places Basho visited during his travels was Hiraizumi, the setting where the great General, 
Minamoto no Yoshitsune (1159&#8212;1189) and his faithful retainer, Musashibo Benkei, were attacked in the 
castle Koromogawa no Tate. They were eventually surrounded, and to protect Yoshitsune while he retired 
to the inner temple of the castle to commit ritualistic suicide (seppuku), Benkei fought valiantly to 
his death on the bridge in front of the main gate.
</p>
<p>
Basho is believed to have chosen the word <i>natsukusa</i>, translated as
&#8220;summer grasses,&#8221; in reference to that season&#8217;s oppressive heat
and humidity which transform the grasses of spring into rank
weeds&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;an appropriate image for the chaos and treachery of war. By the time Basho 
visited Hiraizumi (precisely five hundred years later) weeds were all that remained where once stood 
the castle in which Yoshitsune and Benkei perished. In his epic travel diary <i>Oku no Hosomichi 
(Narrow Road to the Interior)</i>, Basho comments:
<blockquote>
It was at Palace-on-the-Heights that Yoshitsune and his picked
retainers fortified themselves, but his glory turned in a moment into
this wilderness of grass. &#8220;Countries may fall, but their rivers and
mountains remain; when spring comes to the ruined castle, the grass
is green again.&#8221;&nbsp;<sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup>&nbsp; These lines went through my head as I sat on the
ground, my bamboo hat spread under me. There I sat weeping, unaware
of the passage of time.&nbsp;<sup><font size=-2>3</font></sup>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;d wager that Chad Lee Robinson felt a great sadness as well, when
he wrote the poem we chose for this issue&#8217;s <i>Heron&#8217;s Nest</i> Award.
</p>
<p>
I don&#8217;t recall having read a haiku that alludes to more than one
historic event, as Robinson&#8217;s does. Not only does it do this, and to
great effect, but the Basho haiku referred to by one of Robinson&#8217;s
allusions is itself famous for the depth and poignancy of its
allusiveness. Quite a feat! I greatly admire what Chad Lee Robinson
has achieved with this haiku.
