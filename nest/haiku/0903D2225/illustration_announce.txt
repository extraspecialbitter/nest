Dear Friends and Readers of The Heron's Nest,

The deadline for our annual illustration contest is less than a 
week away! I'd like to receive a few more submissions than we have
already, however, so I'm going to extend the deadline one more month, 
to November the first.

To view the contest guidelines please navigate to:

With thanks to those of you who have already sent us artwork, and
encouragement to those who have work to share but haven't yet sent
anything.


Christopher Herold
