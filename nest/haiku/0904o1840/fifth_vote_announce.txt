Dear Friends and Readers of The Nest,

One last reminder that, if you haven't already done so, there are only 
two more days in which to get votes to me for your favorite haiku from 
The Heron's Nests of 2007. The deadline is midnight, January 15! 

Voting is a wonderful opportunity, not only to honor the poems and poets 
who have most deeply touched you, but also to get further in touch with 
the aspects of haiku that speak to you most compellingly. For voting 
guidelines, please go to:

Again, if you haven't already done so, I hope you're planning to purchase 
a copy of the paper edition of Volume IX. It's going to be a wonderful 
collection. For for costs and where to send a check, go to:

The information is in the left-hand column.

With my best wishes, as always,

Christopher Herold
