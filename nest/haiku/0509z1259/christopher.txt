COMMENTARY

It^Òs my turn to write commentary on the poem we editors unanimously
voted our favorite for September. I begin as I normally do, sitting
quietly for a few minutes, letting go of thoughts, letting myself
settle. Now for the poem. I read it several times, both silently and
aloud. Research is always the next step. I try to learn more about a
plant or animal named, the history of a location, the climate in that
region, or anything else in the poem with which I am unfamiliar. I read
Connie^Òs poem again. Wonderful! But there^Òs nothing in it that I don^Òt
already understand.

Wait a minute! When was the last time I plopped myself down on a swing?
Why . . . so long ago I don^Òt remember. Jumping up, I grab my keys and
hurry down to the car, eager to get started on my research. Ha! What fun
this is going to be! I start the car . . . Wait a minute! I^Òm already
short-changing myself! Off goes the engine. My bike^Òs in the garden
shed. Down it comes from the rafter hooks. So much dust! Off to the
kitchen for some rags. Shoot! The tires need air! Now, where did I store
that pump? Not in the holder on the bike, not on the shelves, not in the
footlocker . . . I^Òm getting impatient. How childish! . . . Wait a
minute! Of course! Even my impatience is a part of this! Ha! My research
is going well. Anyway, here^Òs the pump, sticking out of an old planter
box. At last! Tires inflated (but nowhere near as much as me), I climb
on and coast down the driveway.

No one else at the playground this morning and, Yes! Just the right sort
of equipment here too. Three canvas swings hang motionless between heavy
chains. I settle into the middle one and walk backward a couple of
steps. Leaning even further back, I kick my legs out and feel the first
rush of air. Ahhhhhhh! Point those toes! Pull on the chains! Now, tuck
and lean forward! The swing swings back. A little higher with the next
arc, and the next. What d^Òya know! It^Òs got a squeak! The rush of air
gets stronger, a tickly sensation developing in my stomach as I sweep
forward. The sand pit and shrubs vanish behind me as I reach toward the
top of an arc . . . then back they come, rushing into view. Higher!
Higher! Some free-fall now at the highest point as the chains slacken
for a moment . . . a jerk as my slung weight slams them taught again.
Back I go . . . then forward again, faster yet! Now the tall maples
across the sidewalk vanish and . . . yes, here it is in all its blue
glory! The sky! The whole sky! And nothing but the sky!

Boy what fun that was! That was yesterday. I decided to put off writing
until today so I could hang out longer at the playground. The monkey
bars were kinda neat, but I barked a shin. A couple of kids showed up
and one agreed to help me play on the see-saw. What an oddity I must
have seemed to them! Well . . . yeah! And man, you shoulda seen me whack
the tether ball! (Both kids enjoyed beating me at that.) The slides were
way cool! So much I^Òd forgotten!

And now I see that I^Òve forgotten to write about Connie^Òs poem. Heck!
Well, what can I say that she hasn^Òt said better and in far fewer words?
For a more thorough commentary, I recommend that y^Òall get on out to
your local playgrounds!
