Dear Friends and Readers of The Nest,

A gentle nudge to those of you who have been thinking about get your
hands on a copy of Volume VIII but have not yet ordered one. I do 
still have copies available. The cost is $16. Checks can be made out to 
The Heron's Nest and sent to me at:

816 Taft Street 
Port Townsend, WA 98368.

Here's hoping you are all enjoying fine spring weather and coming up
with great new haiku!

Christopher Herold
