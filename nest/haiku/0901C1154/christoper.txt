Subject: THN: March issue

Hello Boston Bird,

In the spirit of the longest possible lead-time, I^Òve taken a break from
formatting the annual paper edition of Volume VIII in order to arrange
and otherwise prepare the March issue. So, here^Òs the first
installment--just the poems. I^Òve included formatting notes where
applicable, hoping to cover that aspect in one fell swoop. 

Once we^Òve finished polishing the commentary, I^Òll send it along too.
I^Òve also omitted the ^ÓFriends of THN^Ô list since there may be a few
more names to add to it before it^Òs time to go live. 

I hope to be sending you the illustration winners for Volume IX soon as
well. I don^Òt remember if you want me to send them as TIFF files or
JPEGs. There^Òs no hurry with those, again in the spirit of lots of
lead-time. I would hope to have them up for viewing (along with the small
amount of attendant copy that I have yet to write) by the middle of
March. Sooner only if you have time.

I know you^Òre exceedingly busy so I hope that at least all of it is
going smoothly. So much to juggle!

Please let me know if there^Òs anything else I can do to make things
easier from a Nest standpoint.

As ever,

Punchy
