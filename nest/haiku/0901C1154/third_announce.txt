Dear Friends and Readers of The Nest,

We are now beginning to collect art for the third annual Heron's Nest
Illustration Contest. As you know, Volumes VII and VIII were the first
Heron's Nests to feature art. We felt certain that illustrations would
be a pleasing new feature but we didn't realize just how pleasing. The
work we received far exceeded our hopes and so we are excited to be
continuing the tradition.

As with the previous two years, we would like to feature heron or
heron-related images on the cover. I think it would be delightful to
focus on nests, a single nest, or perhaps even details of a nest. These
latter suggestions aren't prerequisites, simply ideas.

All submissions may come in the form of photographs, drawings, collages,
or paintings in various media. Impressionistic work will be considered if
the theme of herons or herons' nests is apparent.

The sectional art categories for Volume IX will be the same as in
previous years:

Overview
Spring
Summer
Autumn
Winter
Readers' Choice Awards
Special Mentions
Readers' Comments
Memorials

One big difference is that, in addition to cover submissions, this
year's art for seasonal headings can be submitted either in black and
white, or full color.

Please send all submissions to: 
Christopher Herold 
816 Taft Street
Port Townsend, WA 98368 USA.

SUBMISSION DEADLINE: October the first.
