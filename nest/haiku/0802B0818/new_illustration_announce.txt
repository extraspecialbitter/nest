Dear Poets, Friends, and Readers of The Nest,

I'd like to remind the artists among you that the deadline for submissions 
to the Second Annual Illustration Contest is September 1--just one month 
away! If you are unsure of the guidelines, we have added them to our website. 
You can navigate to them from our home page or simply click:

I eagerly look forward to receiving more of your masterpieces! 

Christopher Herold
