Dear Friends and Readers of The Heron's Nest,

The first annual paper edition of The Heron's Nest was shipped between 
April 7 and 10. I still have a good supply of books if you would like to 
purchase one. The cost is $15 in the U.S., $16 in Canada or Mexico, and 
$17 everywhere else. Please send your checks or money orders to: 
Christopher Herold: 816 Taft Street Port Townsend, WA  98368.

I am now taking pre-publication orders for Volume VIII. Printing a full 
color cover, plus rising postage rates make it necessary for me to raise 
the price a little in order to reach my goal of breaking even. International 
postage is particularly costly. The price of Volume VIII is $16 in the U.S., 
$18 in Canada or Mexico, and $20 elsewhere. Thank you in advance!
