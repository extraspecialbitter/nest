The Second Annual Heron's Nest Illustration Contest

Dear Friends and Readers of The Heron's Nest,

First I would like say once again that we are grateful to every artist who 
submitted work to our first illustration contest. The chosen pieces look  
beautiful in the paper edition of Volume VII. We would like to continue 
this tradition and so it is now time to announce the Second Annual 
Illustration Contest. 

DEADLINE: September 1, 2006

Next year we will print the cover in full color. The inside artwork will 
continue to be produced in black and white. The theme, as ever, will be 
herons and/or their nests, but the art can be suggestive rather than 
realistic. There are ten categories for which we are seeking illustrations. 
They are:
cover / overview / spring / summer / autumn / winter / readers' choice 
awards / memorial / special mentions / voters' comments

* Note on cover art: Submissions can either fit a 5 X 8 format, or be 
intended to wrap around from front to back, as does the cover of Volume VII.

You may submit to one, a few, or all of the above categories. Send seven 
copies of each piece you submit. On the back of one copy for each set 
include your name, address and intended category to: Christopher Herold, 
816 Taft Street, Port Townsend, WA  98368. 

Entries will not be returned unless you request it. If so, please send a 
SASE for that purpose.

As always, we look forward to your work!
