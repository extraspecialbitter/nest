	PRAISE FOR THE PRINT EDITION<br>
OF <i>THE HERON&#8217;S NEST</i> VOLUME VII
</font></h2>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Dear Friends and Haiku Fans,<BR><br>

Fortunately, I had a good many more copies of Volume VII printed than were initially ordered. I still have a good 
supply too, but there&#8217;s a steady stream of orders coming in so, if you are thinking about buying a copy 
of the paper edition, don&#8217;t delay too long. And if you&#8217;re vacillating, read some of these 
enthusiastic responses we&#8217;ve been receiving from subscribers. They just might convince you that it 
would be nice to have a copy too.<BR><br>

With much gratitude,<BR><br>

Christopher Herold

&#8220;easily the most beautiful haiku journal I have ever held in my hands&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;was very moving.&#8221;<br><br>

&#8220;it&#8217;s been so enjoyable revisiting old favourites from the site, while other haiku seem to come into their own in this medium. The format and layout really allow the haiku to breathe, to resonate. It is a fitting celebration of all the dedication and hard work that goes into <i>The Nest</i> and it is certainly a volume that I will dip into often.&#8221;<br><br>

&#8220;I&#8217;m very pleased with the new and first annual publication of <i>The
Heron&#8217;s Nest</i>. It is lovely! What a treasure! A deep gasho to all of
you who worked so long and faithfully to bring it to fruition, and
into our arts. The book feels as if we&#8217;ve truly come of age!&#8221;<br><br>

&#8220;...the combination of the Web as periodical delivery and a nice bound
volume as the keeper is a great way to be doing what you are doing.&#8221;<br><br>

&#8220;...a lovely production&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;looks good and nice to hold.
Congratulations!!&#8221;<br><br>

&#8220;Nara and I both extend our thanks and deep appreciation to you and
all the editors of the <i>Heron&#8217;s Nest</i> for maintaining and preserving the
spirit of haiku through this excellent journal.&#8221;<br><br>

&#8220;<i>The Heron&#8217;s Nest</i> is beautiful.  I love how the beak of the heron on
the front cover leads the reader to open the book. Once opened, it&#8217;s
hard to close.&#8221;<br><br>

&#8220;What a GREAT publication - big ups (as they say round here) to all
involved. It looks good (fantastic cover), is packed with poems and
information and is a thoroughly good read. Congratulations, back slaps
and cheers!&#8221;<br><br>

&#8220;All I can say is WOW! An amazing production in every detail. I must
say I&#8217;m really swept away by it. Truly awesome.&#8221;<br><br>

&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how much pleasure it is to hold in my hands and read
your inaugural annual volume of <i>The Heron&#8217;s Nest</i> for 2005. My mom has
missed the monthly hard copy and is looking forward to her own copy of
the new version of <i>the Nest</i>.&#8221;<br><br>

&#8220;I opened it. I felt the weight of it. All I could think was "It is so
handsome". It is! You have provided your people with hours and hours
of bliss. The cover is gorgeous. In fact every illustration is quite
exceptional. The layout is clear and unassuming. The paper luxurious.&#8221;<br><br>

&#8220;I have just received my first edition of the NEW <i>Heron&#8217;s Nest</i>...It is
beautiful and so rich in every way. It has a lovely heft and wonderful
feel, great artwork and, of course, the cream of the haiku writer&#8217;s
art. It is a publication of true beauty and great worth.&#8221;<br><br>
