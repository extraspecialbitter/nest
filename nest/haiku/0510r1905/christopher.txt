Here 'tis good buddy! The Nest for October.

I think it's in good shape. A fine issue and Peggy wrote an
amazing commentary. Truly superb. Connie is going to be
blown away to get back-to-back awards! She'll be coming to my
house in a few days for the monthly NAP (Nest Assembly Party).
I'm not sayin' a word, but will be on hand with smelling salts
when, as she starts collating, she discovers the surprise for
herself. Gawd I love that kinda stuff. I'll make sure Carol has
our digital camera ready. Will send y'all pics of the magic moment.
Gonna be FUN!

Hope all's going as smoothly for you as it's been for dem BoSox
lately. They can't catch the Yanks but they could well beat out
our Ms for the Wild Card spot. Sheesh. I hate to route against
you but I gotsta!

Yers, as ever,

Punchy

summer garden
the full stretch

Connie Donleycott


COMMENTARY

Haiku poets open themselves to the significant flashes of insight
available through direct realization of everyday experiences. A sound,
smell, or taste can awaken them to the profound suchness of a moment in
time. Disparate images converge to convey resonant intuitions that link
nature and human spirit. Haiku becomes a way of life, and the poet who
lives in quiet harmony with that way trusts the sparest presentation of
essential details to engage the sensory involvement of readers and make
them participants and co-creators.

Connie Donleycott's "summer garden" is a splendid case in point. She
names the season and setting, knowing readers will supply tomatoes,
cucumbers, peas and beans, sunflowers, dahlias, marigolds, onions, and
melons^×whatever colorful images of lush abundance the context brings to
mind. Each reader can easily stand in the garden he or she imagines,
ready to become part of the poem.

This time it is a kinesthetic response that provides the tug into haiku
awareness.  The garden hose reaches its limit and signals resistance
with a backward pull. Gardener, poet, and reader register "the full
stretch" and instinctively appreciate the expansiveness of summer's
bounty just as they recognize its demands. They sense the unstated
likeness of the summer garden to full adulthood, that season of greatest
human productivity and of challenges that test and stretch individual
capacity. Perhaps the instant of heightened understanding includes
consciousness, too, of states of being that require the full measure of
human energy, physical, spiritual, and emotional. Because the poem is
lean, simple, and imbued with karumi (lightness), we are left with a
smile and a comfortable sense of adequacy. Just beyond the margins,
though, lies recognition that when plenty becomes excess the equation
shifts. Strain replaces tautness, and enough is suddenly too much. The
pull of the hose is a gentle reality check.

The poet knows about heat and effort.  She appreciates the rewards of
planning and nurturing. At an instant's signal from a hollow rubber
tube, she recognizes limitations as well.  We can imagine, if we want
to, just how far an adjustment of the nozzle might extend the reach of
life-giving water or what other methods a gardener might use to care for
plants that have grown beyond ordinary reach. Haiku, after all, are
open-ended and allow the reader to move back and forth in time on the
pivot of the present moment. Past and future merge.  So do small and
large, local and universal. A sensation that quivers briefly through the
body informs the mind and spirit.

Connie Donleycott writes clearly and honestly about real things in the
real world, especially the ordinary activities of daily life. With
characteristic freshness, she shares this moment of heightened awareness
in her summer garden so effectively that her readers are blessed with a
richer understanding of their world and themselves.
