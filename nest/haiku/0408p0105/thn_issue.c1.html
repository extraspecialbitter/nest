John Stevenson
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heat of the day lingers into evening. Someone's front door is
left open to allow air to circulate. With matter-of-fact simplicity,
John Stevenson depicts a commonplace scene. Part of what makes this
haiku effective is that the presented imagery suggests a profusion of
other images, all of which resonate beautifully. Although cicadas are
not mentioned, they are there. I hear them. I can also see fireflies and
smell a barbecue. It's easy to imagine these things and many more: a
shooting star, distant music, the scent of jasmine or freshly mown grass
. . .
</P>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More now than ever before, the news is filled with horrific and
tragic stories from all over the world. The stress that builds up from
monitoring these events can easily cause us to forget more peaceful
times and the goodness in people. In this especially worrisome epoch, it
is a relief to read a calming haiku such as this one by John Stevenson.
He reminds us that it is still possible to feel safe, to open ourselves
to the world beyond our doors. I feel welcomed by this poem, and through
it, into a stranger's living room. A stranger who is not really so
strange after all. The poem itself is a door to our commonality.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More often than not the doors to our houses are closed to the world
outside. We see into other people's homes, and their lives, through
books, television, and movies. How pleasant it is to take a walk on a
summer evening, to look into an open door and catch a glimpse of
someone's domestic scene, a place where facades are put aside. The
person inside the house and the poet passing on the sidewalk may even
wave to each other.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm impressed by the way this poem progresses. With a first line of
just two words, Stevenson presents the overall scene. Evening warmth
indicates summer, the season during which we tend to be more outgoing.
The second line is, both literally and figuratively, &#147;an open door.&#148;
When we close our doors, we are essentially protecting ourselves from
the very life we want to live. Our homes are finite places, but the home
in this poem is not closed to the infinite reach beyond its walls. That
is good. The final line brings me back from the expansiveness of the
great out-of-doors to a particular place. All at once I realize that
although this living room belongs to someone in particular, the
knowledge of what such a room represents is shared by just about all of
us. In other words, &#147;someone's living room&#148; is first understood as a
specific place, then a place in general&#150;it could be anyone's living
room. The recognition of this results in a sense of familiarity that is
both welcoming and reassuring.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the most obvious break comes at the end of the first line,
Stevenson has not placed punctuation there. This may be so that it is
also possible for us to read through all three lines without stopping.
Try it. The warm evening becomes itself the open door, an invitation to
give ourselves over to what we share in common, the natural world. In a
very basic way, the weather moves us to open our doors and to meet in a
much more spacious living room.
