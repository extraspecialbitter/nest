Dear Friends and Readers of The Heron's Nest,

We are about a month away, give or take a day or two, from sending out 
the paper edition of Volume IX. I've spent a good deal of time getting 
the manuscript ready to go to the printer and in the process was impressed 
all over again with the quality of poems. What an amazing group of poets! 

If you've not yet reserved a copy (or copies), now would be an excellent 
time to put in your order. The costs per copy are as follows: $16 in the 
U.S.; $18 in Canada or Mexico; $20 elsewhere. Checks can be written out 
to The Heron's Nest. Please send your checks or money orders to me.

My address is:

816 Taft Street
Port Townsend, WA 98368

In the spirit of haiku,

Christopher Herold
