THE THIRD ANNUAL <i>HERON&#8217;S NEST</i><br>ILLUSTRATION CONTEST
</font></h2>

<p>
Once again our call for art to complement the paper edition of <i>The 
Heron&#8217;s Nest</i>, Volume IX has been answered bountifully. Considerable 
talent was utilized  by twenty-two artists from England, New Zealand, Poland, 
Canada, and the United States. We appreciate that the artists also expended 
a good deal of time and energy to prepare their art for submission.
</p>
<p>
The paper edition of Volume IX will feature cover-art and illustrations 
for each of the sectional headings within the volume. There were many 
fine pieces offered in several media: watercolors, ink paintings, drawings, 
photographs, and mixed-media. Our choices were based on overall quality 
and the need to achieve a healthy balance between consistency and variety 
in the visual aspects of the upcoming book.
</p>
<p>
This year&#8217;s cover, created by Jamie Edgecombe, is both striking and 
subtle. Describing the techniques he employed to create his two selected 
pieces, Jamie wrote: &#8220;The undercoat / sketch, which comes through 
the later layers, is made in a <i>suiboku / sumi-e</i> style. The painting is 
then layered with white and black spray paint, using homemade stencils 
and free spray-painting. Although I use modern painting methods for the 
second stage, I still bear in mind the idea of negative spaces employed 
in both suiboku and <i>sumi-e</i>.&#8221; The illustration you see below will 
be folded twice in the middle to form a spine. The front is to the right side.

Using the same mixed-media techniques, Mr. Edgecombe came up with this 
second fine painting. It will be used to lead into the overview of Volume IX.

We were delighted by five magnificent photographs. The first three, by 
C. Avery, will open Nest issues which appeared in spring, summer, and 
fall of last year. Spring is nicely depicted by this colorful welcoming 
in of the out-of-doors:

An implication of autumn, this single, spent banana leaf is not without 
a touch of humor when viewed in context with the notion of being a kigo.

Holding within it the colors of the sky, Natalia Rudychev&#8217;s icicle 
is a splendid seasonal reference.

Doris Thurston&#8217;s simple cartoon-like drawings are delightful, her 
humor contagious. Both of renderings capture the spirit of the Readers&#8217; 
Choice Awards, providing a sense of celebration as well as comic relief. 
The first drawing will begin the Readers&#8217; Choice Awards section.

Ruth Yarrow&#8217;s graceful <i>sumi-e</i> heron is bent forward in search of food. 
We imagine that, at this point in Volume IX, readers will likewise be looking 
eagerly forward to learn results of the contest and which poems received 
the most votes from our readers. Ruth&#8217;s painting will seque into the 
Readers&#8217; Choice Awards overview.

Doris Thurston&#8217;s second drawing furnishes us with an amusing start to 
the &#8220;Readers&#8217; Comments&#8221; portion of the awards section.

Sandra Simpson&#8217;s <i>sumi-e</i> painting introduces the &#8220;special 
mention&#8221; section. The graceful bend of the leaves and the flower stalk 
beckon us forward to read still more of the poems that received high scores 
from readers.

We keenly feel Christopher Patchel&#8217;s inspiration in his photograph of 
an empty bench, silhouetted against a pink stripe of sunset (or sunrise), 
Venus in the distance. Somehow this image evokes a sense of possibility, 
as well as that of loss, both elements we sought for to introduce the 
Kay Anderson memorial.
