Dear Friends and Readers,

Our invitation to participate in the ninth annual Heron’s Nest 
Readers’ Choice Awards has been responded to by a record number 
of voters. We thank all of you who took time out of your busy lives 
to review all of last year’s poems and to vote. We are delighted 
by the results and can now share them everyone. Please navigate to:

Full coverage of the awards, including an overview, editorial commentary, 
thirty additional poems that merit inclusion in the “special mention” 
section, and comments by several voters will all be presented along with 
the four quarterly issues in their entirety in the paper edition of 
Volume IX, due to come out early in April. 

The cost to purchase a copy of Volume IX is $16 in the United States, 
u.s.$18 in Canada or Mexico, and u.s.$20 elsewhere. Please make checks 
or money orders payable in U.S. funds to The Heron’s Nest or 
Christopher Herold and send to:
