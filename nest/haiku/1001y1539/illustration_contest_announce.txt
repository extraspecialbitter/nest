Dear Friends and Readers of The Heron's Nest,

We are now collecting art for the fourth annual Illustration Contest, 
the winning selections from which will be used in Volume X. 

As in the previous three years, we wish to feature herons or heron-related 
images on the cover. Art submitted for the following sectional categories 
should reflect those categories:

Overview
Spring
Summer
Autumn
Winter
Readers' Choice Awards
Special Mentions
Readers' Comments
Memorials

Submissions this year may be rendered either in color or black and white 
and can be paintings in various media, photographs, drawings, or collages.

Send six (6) copies, all together, of each submitted piece. The work may 
be presented as photocopies in an 8 1/2" X 11" format or smaller. All chosen 
entries will eventually be configured to the size of the book: 5" X 8". 
If you wish to submit electronically, jpegs are acceptable. No entries 
will be returned.
