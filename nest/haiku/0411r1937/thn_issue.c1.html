&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Concision. Classic construction. Concrete imagery. Credibility. They are 
all here. However, while these four qualities almost guarantee an        
adequate haiku, they are elemental and can be found in almost any haiku  
crafted by an experienced writer. Something more makes a poem much       
better than adequate; something more earns this one unusually high marks 
from each Heron's Nest editor. Evocative juxtaposition and haunting      
musicality are also here, and they are the key to its resonance.         
</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This haiku reflects the vast difference in the time spans of two 
infinitely significant events: A whale population's journey 
occurs only twice a year, while the tide rises and falls twice daily.
The sense of a long  
passage of time is reflected in the rhythm of the poem. A migration may
last for several months. The repeated long sound of &#147;a&#148; in the first   
line and again at the end suggests a long-term process rather than an  
event that occurs suddenly. This assonance, coupled with the cadence of
the second and third lines, imparts a song-like quality, so that the   
words seem to fade away rather than come to a sudden stop. Here is a   
haiku that begs to be read aloud.                                      
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The unspoken certainty that human life and nonhuman life are interwoven lies 
in the joining of these precise images. The sense of immediacy is       
another valuable quality. It is easy for me to imagine the awestruck    
author, oblivious of time, watching the journey of whales. At some      
point, while still held in the wonder of their passage, the poet notices
that his footprints and those of his companion(s) are disappearing with 
the rising tide. Along with his sudden awareness of this natural        
juxtaposition of events, comes the flash of insight. The poet lives the 
resonance of the moment.                                                
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The visual imagery alone is beautiful, but I also perceive the poem as a
rich metaphor with subtle foreshadowing. The first line fills me with   
longing to see migrating whales in person, and I am reminded that their 
numbers are diminishing. The implicit message of &#147;all our               
footprints/wash away&#148; leaves me breathless. When the whales are all     
gone, so might the rest of us be too---or at least well on our way out. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In addition to presenting an aesthetically pleasing haiku, the author
invites readers to venture within and explore its connotations. Thank
you, paul m.; I am richer for the journey.
