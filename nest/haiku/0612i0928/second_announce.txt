Dear Friends and Readers of The Nest,

Thus far, voter turn-out to decide who will receive honors in the
Valentine Awards issue for Volume VI of The Heron's Nest (2004)
has been outstanding! We would like to thank those of you who have
already voted, especially in consideration of the extra demands
and stresses that come along with the joys of this time of year.

We also want to remind everyone who intends to participate, but
who haven't sent in votes, that you still have not quite three weeks
until the January 15 deadline.

To vote, review all eleven issues of Volume VI and choose your ten
favorite haiku.  An index of all poets featured in Volume VI can be 
found at <http://www.theheronsnest.com/haiku/thn_va.index.06.html>.
Order those by preference, including the name of the poet, and issues 
in which the poems are published. Send your selections to 
Christopher Herold: <theheronsnest@cablespeed.com>

We wish you happiness and many rewards in the coming year!

For The Heron's Nest staff,

Christopher Herold
Managing Editor
