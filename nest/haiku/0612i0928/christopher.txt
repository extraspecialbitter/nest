Subject: THN: The December issue

Dear Ones,

Here's the December issue for you to peruse and proof.

B3, this is coming to you earlier than usual. That's 'cause we're not in
the middle of a selection process for once. Praise the Lord! So, upload
it when you have some time. There are ten more poems than usual and so
we'll need one extra page for the web. I'll send along a new
announcement a little later this month--an exclamation that the
Valentine Awards voting is to begin.

Enjoy!

Punchy T. Heron

ps: I'll also attach this document for those of you who find it easier
to access
that way.

pps: I believe that there are four poems here that need line
adjustments. One
of them is my own. The second and third lines both line up under the "a"
of
that." Thanks.

COMMENTARY

No season evokes such a profound sense of austerity and loneliness as
winter. And no life event exacerbates one^Òs sense of
"me-against-the-world" as much as a sick child.

Think about it: all of the trees are bare and trembling in the raw
breeze. What was once a lush, green lawn is now a gray-white tarp of
hardened snow. The vibrant streetlife of the city has retreated to
gas-powered fireplaces and cable television reruns. Life has become an
indoor sport.

When a child becomes sick, however, the sporting life is tagged out at
home plate. Parents run out of arms and legs very quickly. Forget the
marathon you ran three years ago^×can you pace the length of a two
bedroom apartment for six hours straight?  I think of this line from one
of my favorite poems^×Marriage, by Gregory Corso: "I am sleepless, worn,
up for nights, head bowed against a quiet window, the past behind me,
finding myself in the most common of situations a trembling man." * Yes,
this is a common situation, but who is sharing it with me, at this, my
darkest hour?
When a haiku poet is devoid of inspiration, he or she needs only to look
to the sky. Whether the moon waxes or wanes, shooting stars silently arc
above us, or clouds render the heavens a featureless expanse of utter
nothingness, it is often our only consistent Muse. Winter stars are all
the more poignant in their contrast with the dark winter sky, a contrast
that heightens with each sleepless hour.

Joann Klontz has looked to the stars for both inspiration and solace.
They cannot cradle a crying child or soothe a feverish face, but they
offer an image of constancy in a world that seems to be spiraling out of
control. They provide a deep sense of connectedness which overcomes all
obstacles and all distances^×our imaginations^Ò assembly of the stars into
constellations, the uniquely intimate bond of mother and child, and
ultimately the connectedness of all beings who share the act of caring.
When no one else shows up for the midnight watch, the winter stars stand
silent vigil with those who long for daylight.
