Dear Friends and Readers of The Heron's Nest,

If you plan to participate in the Valentine Awards voting, you have 
five more days before the deadline. We do hope, if you haven't 
already done so, that you'll send us your favorite ten poems from 
Volume VI of The Heron's Nest (in order of preference). 

Send your choices to me:

email: <theheronsnest@cablespeed.com>    or
post:  816 Taft Street, Port Townsend,  WA 98368

Thank you!

Wishing you all a great year!

Christopher Herold
