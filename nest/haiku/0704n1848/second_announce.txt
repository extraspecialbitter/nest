TIME TO VOTE!

Dear Friends, Readers, and Heron's Nest contributors,

The December issue of The Nest (the last in Volume VII) is now available for 
your reading pleasure at <http://www.theheronsnest.com/>. With the release 
of this issue comes the opportunity for you to decide which poems are your 
favorites that we published this past year and which poets were most admired. 
The results, formerly The Valentine Awards, now The Readers' Choice Awards, 
will be published in the first annual paper edition of The Heron's Nest, due 
out in late March.

HOW TO VOTE:

The December issue is now posted on-line. The other three issues in Volume 
VII are archived and easily accessible. 

Review all Volume VII poems by navigating to the "Volume Contents" page: 
<http://www.theheronsnest.com/haiku/>. There you'll find the quarterly issues 
with their respective haiku pages and indexes of poets.  Read through each 
of the issues and create a list of your favorite poems. Then narrow the field 
to just ten poems. Rank them in your order of preference with the first being 
your top choice. All poems in the quarterly issues of Volume VII are eligible 
except for poems included in memorials, poems written by The Heron's Nest 
editors or web-master and, of course, you may not vote for your own work. 
A Master List of poets who contributed work to Volume VII is now on-line at
<http://www.theheronsnest.com/haiku/thn_va_index.07.html>.  In the past it
has been very helpful in locating poems by particular poets. 

Send your chosen list of poems to Managing Editor, Christopher Herold: 
<theheronsnest@cablespeed.com> 

DEADLINE: January 15.
