              Francine Porad </p>
            <p>It is most unusual to use a proper name in a haiku. Since a majority of
              readers would be unlikely to know who the person is, there would seem to be
              an unbridgeable gap between the poet and the reader, which of course, 
              runs contrary to haiku sensibility. Yet this poem is proof that a proper 
              noun can be effective when obviously symbolic of a close personal relationship. 
              That Francine refers to Bernard by name makes this poem far more poignant 
              than if she were to have written impersonally of &#8220;him.&#8221; </p>
            <p> &#8220;Even the jays,&#8221; (brash and careless as they are) 
              sense that something has
              changed. Where there&#8217;s usually food to be found, there&#8217;s 
              none. But this haiku
              isn't about birds. It isn&#8217;t about Bernard either, nor is it 
              just about
              Francine, who is now facing a void in her life. Even the emptiness 
              she feels
              (the emotional crux of this poem) tells but half the story. By themselves,
              each of these elements say little of what the poet wishes to express. 
              By
              putting them together, however, Francine Porad has painted a vivid 
              picture of
              indisputable truth: the only constant is change and to survive we 
              must be
              adaptable.
            </p>
            <p> The emptiness that the jays discover is only that in a feeding 
              station. The
              poet describes emptiness felt as a result of profound loss. Even 
              though there
              are readers who don&#8217;t know anything of Francine Porad, of 
              her life and her
              works, they cannot help but glean that Bernard is someone important 
              to her
              and that he is gone. Those who do know Francine are aware that Bernard 
              was
              her husband and that he recently passed away.</p>
            <p> To one degree or another relationships involve dependencies and 
              compromises.
              Some are so subtle that they aren&#8217;t noticed until one partner 
              is no longer
              physically present. The recognition of Bernard's absence accentuates 
              the fact
              that he continues to exist in Francine's life. They were married 
              for over 50
              years. Memories of him are sure to arise again and again, often 
              quite
              unexpectedly, and sometimes in odd places.</p>
            <p> Along with &#8220;empty,&#8221; &#8220;even,&#8221; and &#8220;Bernard,&#8221; 
              the word &#8220;seed&#8221; is important to
              this haiku. Through it, Bernard is seen to have been a provider. 
              Not only did
              he provide for his family, he routinely fed the birds. What power 
              Francine
              creates by juxtaposing Bernard's absence (emptiness) with something 
              so full
              of life as a seed! In this poem, seed can be thought of as physical,
              intellectual, and emotional nutrition for a relationship. The bird 
              house is
              not the only house that is empty.
            </p>
            <p>Ultimately, this poem is about change and the spirit necessary 
              to adjust to
              ever-changing circumstances. Even at a difficult time of loss, Francine 
              Porad
              is so sensitively attuned that she recognizes her feelings objectively 
              and
              has the courage to express those feelings through art and poetry. 
              This makes
              me happy. It affirms that she is indeed thriving. </p>
