TIME TO VOTE!

Dear Friends, Readers, and Heron's Nest contributors,

The December issue of The Heron's Nest (our last in Volume X) is now 
available for your reading pleasure at <http://www.theheronsnest.com/>. 
With the release of this issue comes the opportunity for you to decide 
which poems are your favorites that we published this past year. 
The results will be published in the annual paper edition due out in April. 
If you haven't ordered a copy, we hope you plan to do so soon.

HOW TO VOTE:

Review all Volume X poems by navigating to the "Volume Contents" page at
<http://www.theheronsnest.com/haiku/>. There you'll find the quarterly 
issues with their respective haiku pages and indices of poets. Read through 
each of the issues and create a list of your favorite poems. Then narrow 
the field to just ten. Rank those ten in your order of preference with 
the first being your top choice. All poems in the quarterly issues of 
Volume X are eligible except for poems included in memorials, poems 
written by The Heron's Nest editors or web-master and, of course, you 
may not vote for your own work. A Master Index of poets who contributed 
work to Volume X has also been created. It should prove very helpful in 
locating poems by particular poets. The Master Index can be found at
<http://www.theheronsnest.com/haiku/thn_va_index.10.html>.

Send your chosen list of poems to Managing Editor, John Stevenson at
<ithacan@earthlink.net> 

DEADLINE: January 15, 2009.
