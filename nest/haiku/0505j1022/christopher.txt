Hey there my friend,

Guess what time it is? Yup, it's NEST TIME! Hallelujah!

Here, for your reading pleasure and manipulation is the May issue. I
think it's nigh on close to perfect,
but I also imagine it'll need a tweak or two by the time it's fully
installed in your web template.

Sorry I haven't gotten around to calling you or Tako yet. Carol and I
just got back from two weeks out of town. We went down to San Diego to
visit our daughter. Great trip!

Hope things are doing well for you. I know you must be happy about dem
Sox! Yessiree! The Ms
are doing fairly well too, and how 'bout dem Giants! Whew! . . . . . .
damn yankees!

I'll be more in touch wid ya soon. 'til then, all good things!

Punchy mon

spring morning
the raven goes
where the wind went

                Elizabeth Searle Lamb
 

COMMENTARY

The life force surges through each line of this vibrant haiku. Season,
time of day, raven^Òs flight, and vanished wind fuse to celebrate the
pure joy of being. I love the spontaneity and movement. My spirits are
caught in soaring exuberance and drawn to the grand expanse of sky.

Edgar Allen Poe^Òs raven is a creature of "bleak December," compressing
loss and negation into its dreary "Nevermore." Elizabeth Searle Lamb^Òs
seems quite the opposite. The last two lines of the haiku are like an
incantation, evoking thoughts of Native American shamanism and tales of
the raven as creator, trickster,  navigator, bringer of light and fire.
Above all, the raven of the haiku is a real songbird, a lover of high
places, acquainted with wind and space. Its wild and powerful flight
provides the energy of the moment within the context of rebirth and
renewal. If its darkness encompasses deeper, harsher aspects of nature
and reality, the contrast only accentuates the strength and lifefulness
of its grand wing beats. This particular "spring morning" embraces
creature, poet, and readers in a heightened moment of experience and
awareness.
Here are two other haiku by Elizabeth Searle Lamb that rival "spring
morning" in the expression of elan:

       field of wild iris^×
       the pinto pony
       kicks up his heels 1    (superscript number one for footnote)

       the meadowlark
       holding down the fencepost
       with song 1     (superscript number one for footnote)

Each in its own way, pony, meadowlark, and raven engage us in the thrill
of being.

A founding member of The Haiku Society of America, Elizabeth Searle Lamb
was editor of Frogpond from 1988-1991 and again in 1994. Many poets who
are now submitting to The Heron^Òs Nest sent their work to Elizabeth
during those years, and treasured her personal responses. She often
signed her notes, "May haiku bring you joy!"  "Spring morning" is imbued
with precisely that joy and shares it generously with receptive readers.
I believe Elizabeth would be glad for those of us who love reading,
writing, and experiencing haiku to adopt that benediction as we
communicate with each other. Whatever the season, wherever you are, may
haiku bring you joy!
