              Rick Tarquinio</p>
			  <p>Only rarely does a haiku hold me as this one has. How could such a
tranquil depiction of an ordinary experience jolt me to my core? As a
quiet river contains depths not divined by the casual observer, so Rick
Tarquinio&#8217;s poem contains depth of meaning beyond the immediate
imagery&#8212;for those readers who will &#8220;drop the plumb.&#8221;</p>
<p>At first reading, the haiku evokes a peaceful scene, and its alluring
physicality draws me in. Unmodified, the moon traditionally denotes a
full autumn moon. I have a sense of early autumn, when days are still
warm, and the hours between sunset and sunrise only hint at the nearness
of winter. It is night. I imagine a thick wooden rail, worn smooth by
decades of sun, wind, and rain. The author leans against it, absorbing
the small dramas that play around him. The rise and fall of insect
songs. The steady lap of water against piles. Within the nearby woods,
herons squabble over roosting spots. Things drift downstream in the
current of the wide, slow river . . .  a bit of paper, a small tree
branch, a boat with two lovers who don&#8217;t bother to row; thin, lacy cloud
reflections sliding over and past the moon. In my bystander&#8217;s role, I
think dreamily, &#8220;Everything . . . drifting downstream,&#8221; and then, I
whisper &#8220;Ohh!&#8221;  Because I get it.</p>
<p>Most exceptional haiku share two basic characteristics: (1) They
resonate on more than one level; (2) Much or all of their resonance lies
in what they imply, not in what they say. By experiencing the instant of
insight, I open another door into &#8220;weathered bridge&#8221; and find a deeper
level of resonance. Tarquinio&#8217;s haiku is the consummate metaphor for the
way I sometimes view my life.</p>
<p>This poet writes without excess; he completes the poem with nothing to
spare.  Tarquinio doesn&#8217;t mention time or age, yet he begins with a word
that suggests the passing of years, that many seasons have come and gone
since travelers began crossing here. A bridge is a structure providing
passage over a gap; this bridge also connotes a passage over time. The
second and third lines are a vivid reminder that while countless things
may endure longer than humanity, the effects of time are ceaseless. The
phrase &#8220;everything but the moon&#8221; typifies the changes that occur in the
course of one&#8217;s life. The words &#8220;drifting downstream&#8221; signal that change
is the only constant, that perceived constancies create only an illusion
of permanence.  Things and people do drift away from us, or we from
them&#8212;youth, hometowns, beliefs, and abilities; friends and family;
landmarks of life as well as simple irritants and pleasures. One way or
another, &#8220;everything but the moon/drifting downstream.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having reached this present state of mind, I reflect on my life&#8217;s
journey. Not for the first time, I start to dwell on regrets, to list
all the things I should have done better, to bemoan my often unwise use
of precious years. But here is Tarquinio&#8217;s beautiful haiku, an artesian
well of epiphanies, and it won&#8217;t let me continue this indulgence of
self-rebuke. Because after all, there is the moon, full and bright and
as permanent as anything we will ever know; and the river flows under
the bridge before it reaches the sea. Sometimes, that&#8217;s all we need to
know.</p>
