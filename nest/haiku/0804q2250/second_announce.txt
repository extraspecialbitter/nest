Dear Friends and Readers of The Nest,

I'd like to remind you that the December 15 deadline for submissions to
the March issue of Volume IX  is fast approaching. I do hope you'll
cobble together some of your finest work to send to the editors.

I'd also like to remind you that Readers' Choice voting for your
favorite poems in Volume VIII is in full sway with a January 15
deadline for your ballots. Here's how to vote:

Review all Volume VIII poems by navigating to the "Volume Contents"
page: <http://www.theheronsnest.com/haiku/>. There you'll find the
quarterly issues with their respective haiku pages and indices of
poets. Read through each of the issues and create a list of your
favorite poems. Then narrow the field to just ten. Rank those ten in
your order of preference with the first being your top choice. All
poems in the quarterly issues of Volume VIII are eligible except for
poems included in memorials, poems written by The Heron's Nest editors
or web-master and, of course, you may not vote for your own work. A
Master List of poets who contributed work to Volume VIII has also been
created. It should prove helpful in locating poems by particular poets.

Send your chosen list of poems to Managing Editor, Christopher Herold:
<theheronsnest@cablespeed.com>

DEADLINE: January 15.
