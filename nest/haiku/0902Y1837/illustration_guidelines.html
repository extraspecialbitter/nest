<p>
The Editors and staff of <i>The Heron&#8217;s Nest</i> invite you to submit 
samples of your artwork to consider for the third annual print edition of 
<i>The Heron&#8217;s Nest</i> (Volume IX).
We are now collecting art for the third annual <i>The Heron&#8217;s Nest</i>
Illustration Contest. As you know, Volumes VII and VIII were the first 
<i>The Heron&#8217;s Nests</i> to feature art. We felt certain that  
illustrations would be a pleasing new feature but we didn&#8217;t realize  
just how pleasing. The work we received far exceeded our hopes and so  
we are excited to be continuing the tradition.
</p>

<p>
As with the previous two years, we would like to feature heron or  
heron-related images on the cover. I think it would be delightful to  
focus on nests, a single nest, or perhaps even details of a nest.  
These latter suggestions aren&#8217;t prerequisites, simply ideas.
</p>
<p>
Sectional art categories for Volume IX will be the same as in  
previous years:

</p>
<p>
All submissions may come in the form of photographs, drawings,  
collages, or paintings in various media. Impressionistic work will be  
considered if the theme of herons or herons&#8217; nests is apparent.
</p>

<p>
Art may be submitted in its original form or as photocopies. Please  
send six (6) copies. The work may be presented in an 
8 1/2&#8221; X 11&#8221;  
format or smaller. All chosen work will eventually be configured to  
the size of the book: 5&#8221; X 8&#8221;
</p>

<p>
This year, art for the seasonal headings as well as cover-art, will  
be reproduced either in black-and-white, or full color depending upon  
what pieces are selected.
</p>

<p>
If you wish your artwork returned, please send a SASE.
</p>

<p>
All entries are to be sent to Christopher Herold, 816 Taft Street, Port
Townsend, WA 98368. Judges will be the editors and staff of <i>The
Heron&#8217;s Nest</i> and a professional artist yet to be selected.
</p>

<p>
SUBMISSION DEADLINE: October the first.
</p>

<p>
In the spirit of haikai,</p>

<p>
Christopher Herold</p>
