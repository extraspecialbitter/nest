Kay F. Anderson, Life-Dancer<br>

<i>(by Michael Dylan Welch)</i>

<p>

<a name=POEM1></a>
Those who met Kay Anderson couldn&#8217;t help but be changed by her  
spirit of joy. I first met her in the early 1990s at a meeting of the  
Haiku Poets of Northern California in San Francisco. When Christopher  
Herold and I were editing the group&#8217;s journal Woodnotes, the first  
poem we published by her, from issue #14 (Autumn, 1992), was this:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
rainy day&nbsp;&#8212;<br>
sharing my bread<br>
with a peg-leg grackle
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
In 1993, I was drawn to take a class in sumi-e brush painting in  
Redwood City. Much to my surprise, when I showed up at the first  
class, there was Kay! She stuck with it and over the years many haiku  
poets have seen her heartfelt work. At the time of the class, she  
would have been nearly sixty years old, still learning, still eager  
to try something new. Here&#8217;s a poem by Kay from Woodnotes #18  
(Autumn, 1993):
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
first sumi-e lesson&nbsp;&#8212;<br>
what I need<br>
is the teacher&#8217;s brush
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Kay was also my nearest haiku neighbour for many years. She and I  
lived next to salt-water lagoons in Foster City and Redwood Shores,  
towns right next to each other along San Francisco Bay. We&#8217;d  
occasionally get together and share poems, and her poems were often  
about the birds she saw from her back deck. Often her haiku expressed  
a profound, selfless empathy (the following one winning second prize  
in the 1996 Henderson Haiku Contest sponsored by the Haiku Society of  
America):
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
deep silence<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the orphaned nestlings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this third morning
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Yet she wrote vividly about many other topics. I once shared the  
following poem of Kay&#8217;s with a friend who had just been divorced. My  
friend immediately wanted a copy for herself:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
five years<br>
in the wrong window:<br>
the violet&#8217;s first bloom
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
When my wife and I moved north to Seattle, Kay and I kept in touch by  
e-mail. She took particular delight in my becoming a new father and  
enjoyed the stories I shared about my two young children. Her  
positive outlook came, I believe, from an innate youthfulness, always  
seeing the world as just beginning, as full of hope. She valued the  
joy of youth, and encouraged me to savour it in my children. She said  
my son and daughter had changed me, and she was right. And so had she 
&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;for the same reasons. I like to think that something of her joy  
made it into this poem of mine:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
first star . . .<br>
a seashell held<br>
to my baby&#8217;s ear</p>
<p>
</blockquote>

The preceding picture is my favourite of Kay, taken in September of  
2002 at the beach near the Asilomar conference center in Pacific  
Grove, California, at the Yuki Teikei Haiku Society&#8217;s annual  
retreat. What a sparkle in her eyes! Her ready smile and the twirl of  
her arms expressed her joy at being alive&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;despite her diagnosis of  
melanoma. I love how she wanted to be barefoot&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;not just at the beach  
that early autumn day but in all of life, to not hold herself back  
from life&#8217;s full experience. She was a life-dancer. This unguarded  
moment on the beach is the way I want to remember her: ever and  
always as a life-dancer. It was the last time I saw her.&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;Michael Dylan Welch
