              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vincent tripi</p>
            <p>July second, 1826, in a custom-made bed (extra long), in an alcove 
              between office and bedchamber, in a house he designed, the third 
              President of The United States fell into a coma. Very ill for five 
              days from an intestinal malady, probably cancer, Thomas Jefferson 
              was attended by his physician, daughter, family, and friends. The 
              house slaves listened from adjoining rooms and from the basement 
              through the dumbwaiter. For the next two days, Jefferson regained 
              consciousness several times and clearly asked what was the date. 
              Told it was the second of the month, then the third, he fell back 
              insensate each time. When his question was answered that it was 
              the fourth of July, he sighed, and was dead at age eighty-three. 
              He lived until the fiftieth anniversary of the formal signing of 
              The Declaration of Independence he had authored.</p>
            <p>vincent tripi&#8217;s haiku brought to mind this story still told 
              by the docents at Monticello in Virginia. More personally, I was 
              also transported to memories of several deathbeds of my own loved 
              ones.</p>
            <p>The one-word setting, &#8220;deathbed,&#8221; is an extremely powerful 
              beginning for this poem. It evokes images surrounded by ritual. 
              The solemnity and import of the process of dying is quite universal 
              across cultures. With the first line set apart from the rest by 
              an ellipsis, a reader pauses to ponder the natures of death and 
              living. Using a second concise image, tripi tells of friendship. 
              The relationship between the two people, one dying, one surviving, 
              has been a long one and a reader may infer that neither principal 
              is young. The poet himself is indeed central to the poem. He shares 
              this experiencing of death with his friend. The poem&#8217;s third 
              part is the concept of &#8220;firefly.&#8221; In the dark, a firefly 
              is bright then gone again, flying on in blackness. Its reappearance 
              is a flash in a different place. Haiku as a genre can contain such 
              a figurative image. tripi employs it so lightly that its resonance 
              brings me back to the intensity of the opening image. Rather than 
              just mentioning the insect for the setting, perhaps as a line unto 
              itself, he shows the metaphor directly. The technique is masterful, 
              much more subtle and effective. The poet states that what he sees 
              is an imitation. The haiku succeeds because of this gentleness of 
              touch; it avoids an obviousness that would ruin the sharing of deep 
              emotions.</p>
            <p>How powerful is this simple evocation of experience so basic to 
              humans. Light and dark . . . consciousness here and gone . . . life 
              and death. How rich was this friendship, this love.</p>
