THE HERON&#8217;S NEST READERS&#8217; CHOICE AWARDS <br>
VOLUME X&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;2008
</font></h2>

<p>
The Editors and Web Master of <i>The Heron&#8217;s Nest</i> are pleased to announce the results of the Readers&#8217; Choice Awards 
for favorite poems and poets featured in Volume X, 2008.
</p>
<p>
Our thanks to all who found time to consider the 472 haiku we published in 2008 and to register votes for their favorites. We heard 
from fewer voters this year, compared to last year&#8217;s record total of eighty-eight. Still, this year&#8217;s total of 
seventy-four voters is a good turnout. We sent fewer reminders about voting than in recent years and will remedy that next time in 
hopes of hearing from even more readers.
</p>
<p>
The print edition of Volume X, to be mailed in April, will include the contents of all four regular issues, the entire awards report, 
including winning poems and poets along with commentary, special mentions, and a generous sample of comments by readers on individual 
poems and on the voting process, plus winning entries in the Illustration Contest. For information on how to order, please visit

        POPULAR POETS<br>
        <br>
<p>
This category results from totaling the number of points awarded to each poet for their entire body of work in Volume X. 
The most poems one can have accepted in <i>The Nest</i> each year is eight. Obviously, the more poems a person publishes, 
the greater chances he or she has for garnering votes. It follows that success in the Readers&#8217; Choice Awards is significantly 
affected by a poet&#8217;s earlier success in having work accepted by the editors throughout the year. One poet had eight poems 
in Volume X. Two poets had seven poems published and four poets had six published.
</p>
<p>
To put into perspective how well the winners did: the average total points for combined works this year was 26.
