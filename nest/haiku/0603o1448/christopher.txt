Subject: THN - The March Issue

Good Day my friends!

Here is the March issue with the commentary updated and polished. The
Friends of The Heron's Nest is also updated. So . . . time to upload to
the test site for proofing.

I'll be taking the cover to the printer tomorrow or the next day. I plan
to begin printing this issue on Tuesday . . . Wednesday at the latest.
So give it a careful once, twice, or thrice over if 'n' ya please. And,
do check out the poems with offset line arrangements.

Thanks to all for all you do!

Punchy

NOTE TO B3:  In the paper edition version of the commentary I have my
three paragraphs of haibun indented from both margins and decreased
slightly in point size and leading. I^Òm not sure what you can do with
the web edition, but I^Òd like to set-off that section a little to aid
clarification. Thanks.

COMMENTARY

What a surprise to again find myself writing commentary for a poem by
John Stevenson. And so soon! Well . . . not such a surprise really. What
is it about this man^Òs way with words that time and again tweaks us into
perceiving familiar things in fresh and profound ways?

In the role of reader, I stepped into John^Òs shoes (though he may not
have been wearing any), to allow the images he presented to stimulate my
own thoughts and emotions. In other words, I made the moment my own. As
a writer, I^Òll now draw on my own experiences to express (in the form of
a haibun) what I intuit to be the core of John^Òs fine poem.

The sun, having floated free of the horizon, now seems to hover in a
clear sky. The chill of early morning is gone yet there^Òs no one but me
on the beach.

I am weary. The last few weeks of work have been exceedingly stressful.
As deadlines loomed, equipment broke down. Progress slowed and
frustrations were vented. The home front has also been hectic. There^Òs
been a steady stream of appointments: doctor, dentist, tax consultant,
audiologist, opthamologist, and car mechanic. There have been several
dinner parties, two poetry readings, and a jam session. Friends just had
a baby, another friend has died. For the most part, these are now things
of the past. Finally, I have a little time to myself, yet some emotions
linger and I feel hollow, filled with echoes. I^Òm at a low ebb.
A breeze has sprung up. The pungent smell of the paper mill mingles with
those of brine and seaweed. The Klikitat ferry rounds Point Hudson on
its way to Whidbey Island. A gull flaps up from a buoy. The bell clangs,
just once.   (C.H.)

low tide^×
stones that have dried
among those that haven^Òt         (J. S.)

My experience of John^Òs inspired moment is just that, my own. You will
come to it differently. Writing a haibun to accompany his poem was
illuminating; it increased my empathy for the moment John shares with
us. You might enjoy doing the same.

The practice of reading and writing haiku takes us through unending
stages of development. With tenacity, we can reach a stage that R. H.
Blyth described this way: "At the moment of composition or appreciation,
there is no distinction between inner and outer. Life runs so freely
between them that we perceive things by introspection, and our
experiences of the ^Ñouter^Ò world have the same immediacy, validity, and
certainty as have states of pure ^Ñself^Ò consciousness." Anais Nin put it
another way: "We don^Òt see the world as it is; we see it as we are." We
may not always be aware of this while writing our own haiku, but if we
aren^Òt aware of it while reading other poets^Ò work, we are likely to
miss a substantial part of what makes haiku so special. The poet, the
object of inspiration, and (potentially) the reader are inseparable.

John Stevenson made it easy for me to take his place on the beach. His
sandals fit so well I don^Òt feel them^×the sign of an expert craftsman!
