The First Annual<br>
<em>Heron’s Nest</em> Illustration Contest</font></h2>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

The editors and staff of <em>The Heron’s Nest</em> invite you to submit samples of your artwork to be considered for the first annual print edition of <em>The Heron’s Nest</em> (Volume VII).
</p><p>
You can enter two categories, COVER ART and/or SECTIONAL ART.
</p><p>
<strong>COVER ART:</strong> The work in this category must focus on herons or in some way imply their presence. Impressionistic works are acceptable.
</p><p>
<strong>SECTIONAL ART:</strong> The art in this category will be used to separate each of the quarterly issues and the awards issue. There are five possible themes: each of the four seasons and a non-seasonal work that somehow heralds the special feel of an awards presentation.
</p><p>
The art may be in any two-dimensional medium. It may be submitted in color, but it is important that you know that all work will be reproduced in black-and-white. The dimensions of the <em>The Heron’s Nest</em> will be the same as they have been in the past (5 1/2” x 8 1/2”). The masthead and volume number will appear on the cover and the issue number and date will appear on each sectional page. Proofs will be sent to the winners for approval. Only original works that have not been published will be considered. All rights to the art will return to the artist once Volume VII has been printed.
</p><p>
<strong>PLEASE SUBMIT SIX PHOTO-COPIES OF EACH PIECE OF ART</strong> in the dimensions: 5” wide x 8” tall You may submit a maximum of five entries in the first category (cover art) and up to five entries in each of the themes of the second category (sectional art).
</p><p>
<strong>DEADLINE:</strong> in-hand November 1, 2005
</p><p>
All entries should be sent to:<br>
Christopher Herold: 816 Taft Street, Port Townsend, WA 98368.
</p><p>
<strong>JUDGES:</strong> David Noble, a highly-regarded graphic artist and book-cover designer, along with editors and staff of <em>The Heron’s Nest</em>. </p>
