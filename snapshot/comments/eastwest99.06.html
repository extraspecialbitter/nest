			<P><A NAME="C_HEROLD"></A>
				Hello everyone! 
			</P>
			<P>
				Thank you for your excellent submissions &#150; some very creative ideas and perspectives. Narrowed down to two or three stanzas, choosing became quite difficult, but choose I did and we&acute;ll now be able to go on to stanza #7. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="A_BENEDICT"></A>
				Here is my selection for #6: 
			</P>
			<P>
				<FONT FACE="arial"> in the wind the scarecrow 
					<BR>
					waves and waves again </FONT> 
				<BR>
				<BR>
				by Alex Benedict 
			</P>
			<P>
				I like this verse because the wind compels the scarecrow to act, involuntarily, just as the sky-writer is acting out of the human compulsion to test the limits. It&acute;s as if the pilot had no choice but follow his muse. And certainly the pilot too is at the mercy of the wind. Yet the scarecrow is but a parody of humanity. Also, Alex&acute;s verse moves away from the throw-back verse very cleanly as it primes us for the wild ride around the corner, on the next page. 
			</P>
			<P>
				Recognizing seasonal references is still a tricky task for me, as is deciding whether or not some particular thing refers to this season, or that one, or none at all. I have a fair collection of saijiki, but your ideas and comments will always be most welcome. Not only are we collaborating on this renku, we're all in the learning business as well. 
			</P>
			<P><A NAME="F_PORAD"></A>
				Francine Porad&acute;s stanzas: 
			</P>
			<FONT FACE="arial"> 
			<P>
				State Fair blue ribbons 
				<BR>
				henhouse cacophony 
			</P>
		<P>
			migrating swallows 
			<BR>
			as if timed, grandkids arrive 
		</P>
	</FONT> 
	<P>
		Both very interesting shifts. I eliminated Francine&acute;s "State Fair blue ribbons," because my seasonal reference search didn't turn up "State Fair" as a kigo. As it turns out, my search was not thorough enough÷this reference IS an autumn kigo! Now I see that it would have been a strong contender indeed, neck-and-neck with Alex's scarecrow. "Migrating swallows," although a wonderful moment of recognition, refers to "children," which comes too close to images of children in both the throw-back verse (#4), and verse #3. Also, swallows is a reference to spring. And, although &sup3;departing swallows&sup2; is an autumn kigo, &sup3;migrating&sup2; could be construed as either coming or going. 
	</P>
	<P><A NAME="J_KLONTZ"></A>
		Joann Klontz&acute;s stanza: 
	</P>
	<P>
		<FONT FACE="arial"> an orange canopy 
			<BR>
			of sugar maples </FONT> 
	</P>
	<P>
		Of the final two from which I had to choose, this one came close. The reason I passed it up was that "maples" is a LATE autumn kigo, and since we still have one more autumn verse before heading into the love links, it would be easier for everyone to have some room to work with at the end of the season. I like the ambiguity of "canopy,&sup2; relateing both to trees and to the plane's cockpit. The overall image is striking. 
	</P>
	<P><A NAME="L_BELL"></A>
		Laura Bell&acute;s stanza: 
	</P>
	<P>
		<FONT FACE="arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shadows on fallen leaves 
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smell of rain 
	</P>
	<P>
		I like this image &#150; a wonderful sensory input of sight and smell. The shadows actually bring out the smell the rain. But traditionally &sup3;rain,&sup2; isÊ a summer kigo, and we&acute;re in the midst of autumn. 
	</P>
	<P><A NAME="B_HIGGINSON"></A>
		Bill Higginson&acute;s stanza: 
	</P>
	<P>
		<FONT FACE="arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how these rose of sharon blossoms 
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resemble peasant skirts </FONT> 
	</P>
	<P>
		I like the imagery, and the circular feeling of your linkage. Also the way the verse shifts from the rather decadent and frivolous activities of a sky-writer, to the bare bones, simple pleasures of peasants. I couldn&acute;t place this stanza since it contains a repetition of clothing category (verse #3). 
	</P>
	<P><A NAME="M_S_MARTIN"></A>
		Miriam Sachs Martin&acute;s stanza: 
	</P>
	<P>
		<FONT FACE="arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complete 
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the fading now </FONT> 
	</P>
	<P>
		I enjoyed both the sense of successful completion (an "up" feeling), and the sense that everything must fade. By the time the pilot has accomplished his goal, the physical results (vapor trail) are already fading. This also links to the idea of the moon's inevitable waning. Although these are all wonderful qualities, I feel that the linkage to verse #5 is a bit too close, and that the internal imagery is vague, dependent on the content of the previous verse. 
	</P>
	<P><A NAME="C_ODELL"></A>
		Carol O&acute;Dell&acute;s stanzas: 
	</P>
	<P>
		<FONT FACE="arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second time to the same house 
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tiny angel and a pumpkin </FONT> 
	</P>
	<P>
		This is truly a delightful scene and, of course, links to the &sup3;halo&sup2; our pilot is attempting to give the moon. It also echoes the effort of the pilot, only now it&acute;s the kid&acute;s efforts to get as much candy as they can, to the extent of forgetting where they&acute;ve already gone. The problem with the stanza is that (as in Francine&acute;s &sup3;grandkids&sup2;), it is repetitive of the them of children. 
	</P>
	<P>
		<FONT FACE="arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rusted gate overgrown 
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by blue morning glories </FONT> 
	</P>
	<P>
		A beautiful verse. I like the way this verse links, by inverting the pilot&acute;s effort to enclose the moon with a vapor trail, thereby dominating it. Here, nature persists in UNDOING humanity&acute;s efforts to be in control (&sup3;overgrowing&sup2; the &sup3;rusted gate&sup2;). The &sup3;blue&sup2; also links subtlety to sky. Really a good link and shift. The only problem is that there is already a time of day extant, in the hokku. Even though &sup3;morning&sup2; is part of the name of a flower in this case, and not truly a time of day, we must be particularly careful not to repeat anything contained in the hokku. Perhaps this flower could still be used, much later in the renku; I&acute;m not sure. 
	</P>
	<P>
		Okay. We&acute;ve come to the end of the omote (the first page of six stanzas), and it&acute;s time to break out, to adventure wantonly. But remember that we go into the first series of love links after this verse, so think ahead as well as being careful to link to #6. The seventh stanza is a three liner, and needs a reference to autumn. The location can be either inside or outside. 2nd person would be great but a scene would also be okay. Be creative! 
	</P>
	<P>
		The deadline for your submissions will be Saturday morning at 10 am (PST).
