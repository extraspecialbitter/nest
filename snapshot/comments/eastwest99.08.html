Hello everyone,
</P>

<P>
Thank you so much for sending such fine poems, such interesting
responses to what&acute;s been crafted thus far.
</P>

<P>
Stanza #8 is locked in. It links by carrying on with the humor of
Francine&acute;s scarecrow-like seniors, and also links to &quot;look-alikes&quot;.
This new stanza begins the love sequence with by conjuring that first
electrical charge of attraction. In fact, this really opens up the
possibilities. Now it&acute;s time to rev up. So let&acute;s do it! Okay, enough.
Here&acute;s the verse:
</P>

<P>
your sister also<BR>
gives me a wink
</P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by Garry Gay
</P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ninth stanza is a three-liner--another love stanza. Let&acute;s go deeper
into love and passion now. Garry&acute;s encounter could have taken place
either inside or outside (but probably outside, considering the dovetail
with Francine&acute;s folks at the fair), so inside is preferable (shouldn&acute;t
pose a problem, eh?). This link would be very nice in 1st person.
Definitely not 2nd. A scene could work too, but you&acute;d have to be pretty
inventive to get the scene to have sufficient linkage. Remember that
we&acute;re going to be breaking out all over the place for a while, so don&acute;t
be afraid of tangents, but please, remember there should be a link to
Garry&acute;s verse.
</P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: Among other things, linking is a way to indicate that you really
listened, and heard the voice of the person preceding you. You say
&quot;Yeah, I hear that. Now, what about THIS.&quot; Enough already.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a quick note. Although I&acute;d like to make comments on all the stanzas coming in, there are too many. I&acute;m told that the commentary is useful (I know it is to me). Voicing my thoughts really helps clarify them. So I&acute;ve decided to pick out the verses that I felt were closest to hitting the mark, and comment on those. With so many people submitting fine images and ideas, it&acute;s not easy to choose. But there are a total of thirty-six stanzas, so I&acute;ll try to get as many voices into this concerto as I can.
</P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ferris Gilli&acute;s stanza:
</P>

<P>
the warmth of your lips<BR>
on a small birthmark
</P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ferris&acute; link has just the sort of eroticism I was looking for. It came very close indeed to being chosen. As you may know, Ferris won the honorable mention in the hokku contest, so this is her second close call. The link in this verse eluded me. I wanted there to be a stronger connection between the birthmark and the look-alikes, but couldn&acute;t find it. In Garry&acute;s stanza, the sisters clearly could bear a family resemblance, so the link was accessible.
</P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kay Anderson&acute;s stanza:
</P>

<P>
your eyes sparkling<BR>
the windows steamed
</P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kay&acute;s link, although not as overtly erotic as Ferris&acute;, has a beautifully subtle sensuality. This verse also was a close contender, but again, the link was elusive. Had there been a reflection of the lovers in the window, that would certainly have been a link, but the windows were all steamy, for obvious reasons.
</P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings up the question of how closely does one link, and how far can one shift. Of course, this changes according to where we are in the renku, and to the preferences of the person who is making the decisions, if any. Verses 7 through 10 are quite an interesting part of a kasen renku. On one hand we are just leaving the subdued omote (first page, six stanzas), and are expected to do some radical shifting. But almost immediately we are faced with verses 8 through 9 or 10 are love links, and tend to need closer linkage. This is the challenge of which we&acute;re in the midst.
</P>
