<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bumper crop!
</P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from the hokku, this verse has received more entries than any
other stanza, which has made my decision very difficult since so many
are so good! You have been very sensitive to what I'm striving to
accomplish: create a well-balanced, interesting poem that (as Steve
Mason has put it) twists and turns. Thank you for your enthusiasm. If we
are successful in our creation of East-West '99, certainly it is due
mostly to the skill of you who are giving such careful consideration to
what is evolving, and what to contribute (nearly 300 stanzas thus far).
</P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there were so many fine verses offered in this round, I'm not
going to cough up any commentary. If I were to delve into the whys and
wherefores for any one verse, I'd feel obligated to do so for all the
others that tantalized me. So I just buckled down and chose what I feel
will be best for the overall poem÷not just the visible, written poem,
but the poem that is you, the poets who are breathing spirit into what
was once just an empty space.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verse #32 is by Carolyne Rohrig. It is:
</P>

<P>
the proud rustle<BR>
of the peacock's tail
</P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verse number #33 is a three-liner that continues in the realm of
non-season. No 3rd person pronouns please; 1st or 2nd person is fine.
Remember to stay light and up-beat. The shift should not be radical from
now on. And I'd like to keep the emphasis on nature in this verse,
though human affairs can be interwoven if done so with reserve.		<P>
</P>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deadline for link #33 is Sunday, August 8 at 9:00 P.M. (PDT).
