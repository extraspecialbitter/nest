		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love the humor in Francine&acute;s verse. We come from an image of a flapping scarecrow, coupled with a struggling sky-writer. This portrays an interesting emotional ambiguity. At the mercy of the wind, the scarecrow evokes a feeling of helplessness, but without a struggle (linking to the sky-writer). Although a rather piteous scene, it is also quite comical. Through the scarecrow/sky-writer we are led to empathize with our own human condition, which embraces not only the piteous, but the absurd. 
	</P>
<P>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Francine makes our first big shift by capitalizing on the humorous aspect of the scarecrow, likening seniors at the fair to wardens of the fields. Just as the scarecrow shows signs of wear and tear, so do the seniors, who now carry themselves far more gingerly than when they were younger. The seniors also look alike, with their gray or white hair and their wrinkles, just as scarecrows tend towards a universal ãlookä of their own. The scarecrow waves, as though to the pilot, the seniors at the fair wave to each other. Maybe the couples are even wearing identical shirts and blouses! 
</P>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We began our journey with a sense of magic, and the mystical. It led into a still subdued trend of sleepy quietude and domesticity. The sky-writer and scarecrow prepared us for a shift and now we have humor, a fine way to leap into adventure. Another nice thing about Francineâs verse is that it gives us a great lead-in to the love sequence, opening the way to further human closeness and the probability of a crazy shift into passion.

			<FONT FACE="arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I won’t be commenting on all verses sent in (I do have a life beyond renku), but I’ll comment on as many as I can. I hope this is as helpful for you as it is for me.&nbsp;</FONT>

			<FONT FACE="arial">Ferris Gilli’s stanza:&nbsp;</FONT> 
		<P>
			<FONT FACE="arial">how you dance&nbsp;</FONT> 
			<BR>
			<FONT FACE="arial">in and out of shadows—&nbsp;</FONT> 
			<BR>
			<FONT FACE="arial">falling leaves&nbsp;</FONT> 
		<P>
			<FONT FACE="arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This verse has mystique and an interesting ambiguity. The mystique comes when you see the dancer as a human. When you see the dancer(s) as leaves, although personified, it is a striking image. According to Higginson, “falling leaves” is a winter kigo. Yuki Teikei’s saijikis point to falling leaves as an autumn kigo, so there is at least some controversy on this point. But more importantly, I’d like the mood to continue to shift away from the quietude of the first four verses. Even the fifth verse seems to me almost more a fantasy, a flight of fancy. So a bigger jump seems needed.&nbsp;</FONT>

			<FONT FACE="arial">Francine Porad’s other stanza:&nbsp;</FONT> 
		<P>
			<FONT FACE="arial">migrating birds&nbsp;</FONT> 
			<BR>
			<FONT FACE="arial">grains of sand tumble&nbsp;</FONT> 
			<BR>
			<FONT FACE="arial">from your sketchbook&nbsp;</FONT> 
		<P>
			<FONT FACE="arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fine verse in and of itself (in true hokku fashion). There is a school of thought that I find myself leaning towards more than I used to. It contends that the only cut verse in a renku should be the hokku. I know I won’t hang on to this concept too tightly, however, and, in context, this verse works very well with the caesura. But I hesitated at the sketchbook, feeling it to be just a little too close to “sky-writer.”&nbsp;</FONT>

			<FONT FACE="arial">Laura Bell’s stanza:&nbsp;</FONT> 
		<P>
			<FONT FACE="arial">autumn breeze&nbsp;</FONT> 
			<BR>
			<FONT FACE="arial">yet another leaf&nbsp;</FONT> 
			<BR>
			<FONT FACE="arial">crowding the backwater&nbsp;</FONT> 
		<P>
			<FONT FACE="arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like this verse very much too. The waving of the scarecrow is now the waving of water (nice link!). So many good haiku (notice the caesura)! But there’s too much of a “breeze” going on already; the sky-writer and the scarecrow are definitely dealing with it. The shakuhachi notes in the wakiku hint at it, and the steam in verse #4 swirls because of the presence of some sort of draft. In retrospect, I may have overlooked the fact that there is so much atmospheric change going on. Even yawns cause air to move. So, let’s get away from wind, and breezes for a long while.&nbsp;</FONT>

			<FONT FACE="arial">Alice Benedict’s stanza:&nbsp;</FONT> 
		<P>
			<FONT FACE="arial">on a square of straw&nbsp;</FONT> 
			<BR>
			<FONT FACE="arial">in the center of the field—&nbsp;</FONT> 
			<BR>
			<FONT FACE="arial">all the pumpkins&nbsp;</FONT> 
		<P>
			<FONT FACE="arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, this is a neat image on its own, and of course links closely to the scarecrow who is also standing in a field. Too closely me thinks. But more than that, the syntax comes too close. “on a square…” and “in the center…” are repetitive of Alex’s “in the wind…”&nbsp;</FONT>

			<FONT FACE="arial">Paul MacNeil’s stanza:&nbsp;</FONT> 
		<P>
			<FONT FACE="arial">collected fog&nbsp;</FONT> 
			<BR>
			<FONT FACE="arial">on the raveled fringe&nbsp;</FONT> 
			<BR>
			<FONT FACE="arial">of her scarf&nbsp;</FONT> 
		<P>
			<FONT FACE="arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excellent observation! I like this a lot as a haiku (even without a caesura), and it would be a good link too. The only problem is that we already have an article of clothing, the slippers in verse #3. Darn!&nbsp;</FONT> 
		<P>
			<FONT FACE="arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new deadline for verse #8 is Monday, July 19 at 9:00 p.m. (PDT).&nbsp;</FONT>
