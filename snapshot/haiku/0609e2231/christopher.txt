> COMMENTARY
>
> Only rarely does a haiku hold me as this one has. How could such a
> tranquil depiction of an ordinary experience jolt me to my core? As a
> quiet river contains depths not divined by the casual observer, so Rick
> Tarquinio's poem contains depth of meaning beyond the immediate
> imagery-for those readers who will "drop the plumb."
>
> At first reading, the haiku evokes a peaceful scene, and its alluring
> physicality draws me in. Unmodified, the moon traditionally denotes a
> full autumn moon. I have a sense of early autumn, when days are still
> warm, and the hours between sunset and sunrise only hint at the nearness
> of winter. It is night. I imagine a thick wooden rail, worn smooth by
> decades of sun, wind, and rain. The author leans against it, absorbing
> the small dramas that play around him. The rise and fall of insect
> songs. The steady lap of water against piles. Within the nearby woods,
> herons squabble over roosting spots. Things drift downstream in the
> current of the wide, slow river . . .  a bit of paper, a small tree
> branch, a boat with two lovers who don't bother to row; thin, lacy cloud
> reflections sliding over and past the moon. In my bystander's role, I
> think dreamily, "Everything . . . drifting downstream," and then, I
> whisper "Ohh!"  Because I get it.
>
> Most exceptional haiku share two basic characteristics: (1) They
> resonate on more than one level; (2) Much or all of their resonance lies
> in what they imply, not in what they say. By experiencing the instant of
> insight, I open another door into "weathered bridge" and find a deeper
> level of resonance. Tarquinio's haiku is the consummate metaphor for the
> way I sometimes view my life.
>
> This poet writes without excess; he completes the poem with nothing to
> spare.  Tarquinio doesn't mention time or age, yet he begins with a word
> that suggests the passing of years, that many seasons have come and gone
> since travelers began crossing here. A bridge is a structure providing
> passage over a gap; this bridge also connotes a passage over time. The
> second and third lines are a vivid reminder that while countless things
> may endure longer than humanity, the effects of time are ceaseless. The
> phrase "everything but the moon" typifies the changes that occur in the
> course of one's life. The words "drifting downstream" signal that change
> is the only constant, that perceived constancies create only an illusion
> of permanence.  Things and people do drift away from us, or we from
> them-youth, hometowns, beliefs, and abilities; friends and family;
> landmarks of life as well as simple irritants and pleasures. One way or
> another, "everything but the moon/drifting downstream."
>
> Having reached this present state of mind, I reflect on my life's
> journey. Not for the first time, I start to dwell on regrets, to list
> all the things I should have done better, to bemoan my often unwise use
> of precious years. But here is Tarquinio's beautiful haiku, an artesian
> well of epiphanies, and it won't let me continue this indulgence of
> self-rebuke. Because after all, there is the moon, full and bright and
> as permanent as anything we will ever know; and the river flows under
> the bridge before it reaches the sea. Sometimes, that's all we need to
> know.
