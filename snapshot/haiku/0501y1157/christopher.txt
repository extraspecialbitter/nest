Hi BBB!

Welp, here it is, as promised, the January issue. It should be
very close to right on. Once you have it up on the trial site we
can all do some careful proofing. Plenty of time for that though.

Thanks a bunch!

tai chi

                COMMENTARY

     Randy Brooks believes "that every haiku has within it a
confirmation of the human heart being fully alive."
http://www.haijinx.com/1-2/brooks/index.html. This one certainly does.
The fluid tai chi movements match the soft unfolding of morning glories.
A new day begins. The participatory presence of the poet's wife
completes the joy.

     Arms and legs open and close. The couple inhale and exhale, their
diaphragms rising and falling as they relax into the ancient dance-like
postures. They sense a connection with nature and inclusion in the
opening, closing, opening of days,
seasons, years.  Present moments, fully lived, expand into timelessness.


     Tai chi could be performed by a couple of any age. Millions of
Chinese people, many of them well into their nineties, gather outdoors
every morning to "move the chi." Practitioners credit the regimen with
sustaining physical fitness, increasing mental alertness, and
encouraging spiritual awakening. Practice puts them in touch with the
vital energy of the body. Because the haiku is signed and I know the
poet, I visualize Randy and Shirley Brooks instead of an elderly Chinese
man and woman. I know that their marriage is strong and of long
duration. Clearly this is a love poem,
a beautiful tribute to the poet's wife. I have no sense, though, of
intruding upon a private moment. The haiku is both restrained and
expansive. The harmony it celebrates comfortably includes the reader.

     Morning glories are early autumn kigo in Japan. In America they
have a long blooming season and are likely to be prominent from July
through October or even longer. The language of poetry encourages us to
imagine a particular morning in late summer or early autumn and a
similar season in the lives of the people portrayed. That tai chi is a
lifetime art suggests associations with the continuity of this
particular marriage and the promise of the relationship's opening
through all seasons to the possibilities of each new day.

     Kigo connect individual haiku to others that use the same images,
creating a powerful literary context that can add layers of meaning and
ongoing resonance. Here are three of my favorites about morning glories:


with morning glories                                morning-glory--
a man eats breakfast                              the well-bucket
entangled
--that is what I am                                     I ask for water

Basho                                                        Chiyo-ni
                               trans. Makoto
Ueda                                trans. Patricia Donegan

and Yoshie Ishibashi


               leaving    all the morning glories    closed

Elizabeth Searle Lamb

     In Japanese this flower is called asagao, which translates as
"morning face." The subtle difference reminds me that while haiku has
become a universal genre, the languages in which it is composed and read
will add their nuances and patinas. That is as it should be.  Each
superb haiku about morning glories will find a unique place among the
others.  Randy's new one interacts meaningfully with the three
classics.  The editors of The Heron's Nest are pleased to begin the new
year by sharing it with our readers.
