Subject: The December Nest

Dear B3 and fellow herons,

Here is the December Nest (with the Kilbride memorial yet
to come). This part is ready for uploading and proofing so
I thought I'd get it to now.

B3, I am about to start assembling he memorial for Jerry.
I thin it's going to be three or four pages long but won't
know until I've put in a couple of hours. At least it's not
as long as Elizabeth's ten-pager. I'll try to get this to you
soon but I'm still waiting on a three or four poets to 
respond with poems. Oh, and please do offer a poem of
your own if you can and want to.

Spike, are you planning on submitting a poem in tribute
of Jerry? I'd like to include each of us but won't be upset
if you, or any one else, chooses not to. Just let me know
so I can get a handle on space needed. Thanks.

Okay, here is most of the December issue. Upload when
you can, B3, and you can all have at it with your proofing
glasses.

Your ch-ch-ch-chief heron, 

Punchy!

The Heron^Òs Nest Award and commentary

country graveyard
      a hummingbird
             she would^Òve loved
Darrell Lindsey

Commentary

A teacher and haiku leader in Japan today, Yoko Sugawa, suggests that in order to say ten things a writer of haiku might write only two. This brings to mind what Matsuo Basho reportedly said to a disciple: ^ÓIs there any good in saying everything?^Ô If you'll pardon my imperfect analogy, some haiku may be likened to icebergs. In the here and now of Darrell Lindsey^Òs haiku (seen above the surface), are the graveyard and a hummingbird.

As they dart about, hummingbirds can fly forwards or backwards and are able to stop in place. Flower shapes and colors attract them. Common throughout the Western Hemisphere, most are tiny, beautiful birds with shimmery iridescent colors. A country graveyard? Certainly trees and shrubs are there among the gravestones and markers. Probably not present are  closely spaced monuments, statuary, and mausoleums of a city cemetery. From its ^Ócountry^Ô setting, I feel a sense of quiet in Lindsey^Òs poem. Unmentioned by the poet are the flowers that I find at this grave. They might be planted there in a pot, the poet may have brought a fresh-cut bouquet, or there may even be permanent, plastic blooms. In any case, a reader may see the hummingbird come to the flowers to investigate at the very least, and to hover and drink nectar if it is present.  

The opening line has a choppiness that complements the darting nature of the bird^Òs search. The contraction ^Ówould^Òve^Ô and the long sound at the end enhance the third line^Òs smooth flow. The last line^Òs content reveals the mind of the writer, his thinking. It is subtly done. Lindsey uses a conditional past tense to wistfully show the situation: this is a grave of someone special to him. He ends the line, and the haiku, with "loved."

A reader may fill in the blank as to just what the relationship of the deceased was to the poet. My first inclination is that the ^Óshe^Ô refers to a wife. It certainly could be a mother, a sister, a grandmother, or even a lover.

We feel the reverence of the moment as poet and a hummingbird meet at this particular grave. Darrell Lindsey remembers his loved one, the bird enlarges that memory, and we readers may also be stimulated to our own special remembrances.
