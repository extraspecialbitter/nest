                COMMENTARY

Original February Nest Essay

snowy night
sometimes you can't be
quiet enough

John Stevenson

The mot juste is "snowy." There is not only falling snow, it is
abundant. The trees, lawns, sidewalks, fences, houses, cars^×all things
in the scene are snow-covered, possibly even the poet. Snowflakes, large
ones, fill the writer^Òs vision. Because the rest of the haiku draws
attention to the lack of sound, the snowfall must be straight down.
Without a storm^Òs wind, the flakes flutter from the dark sky.

The reader doesn^Òt know just where the poet is. Still, there is probably
some man-made light. It is not important to know if the source is car
headlights, street lights, or a lighted house.  Sound, its presence and
absence, dominates the poem. It is about the former that John Stevenson
shows his regret.

John did not take a traditional approach when crafting this haiku. The
last two lines are a conclusion by the poet observer, an opinion. He
speaks in the indefinite second person. Yet, this technique reveals
John^Òs awe at the majestic perfection of the snowy night and extends it
to me. The expansive "you" invites all readers to share the poet^Òs
moment of insight. It works and shows yet again that there are rules
that are not rules. Read aloud, the poem also pleases. The medley of
three sibilant S^Òs is punctuated by four intruding T^Òs.

Sometimes the very presence of the haiku poet or another person changes
what is being observed. The intrusion may be exquisitely painful. The
kayak paddle makes a splash as it enters a lily-filled cove. A walk in
autumn woods is interrupted by leaves so loud underfoot they seem to
echo. The sound of a distant hammer, a jet ski, or an airplane makes a
deer jump, a fish startle, or a dragonfly take off.

I easily recognize the writer^Òs emotional discomfort as he disturbs the
snowy scene; I am drawn in by it. The quiet, and the sheer beauty of
this night, should not be disturbed. The scrunch of new snow compressed
under a booted foot; the car door shutting; the beep as the car locks;
the poet^Òs breathing^×all of these things are just too loud.
