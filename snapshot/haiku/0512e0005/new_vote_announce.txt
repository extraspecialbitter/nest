Dear Nest Readers,

I'd like to remind you that we are now in the midst of receiving votes
for the Valentine Awards. If you haven't already voted, I hope that you
plan to. The deadline is midnight, January 15. For complete voting
guidelines, please go to the following url:

So far this year we're having a great turnout, better than ever before
in fact. We want nothing more than to present the best possible haiku,
the ones that bring you the most enjoyment. By sending in your top ten
choices from Volume V, you'll be honoring your fellow poets and letting
us editors know which poems have been the most inspiring to you.

Wishing you well, as ever,

Christopher Herold
