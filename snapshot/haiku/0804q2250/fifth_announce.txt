Dear Friends and Readers of The Nest,

This is the final reminder that the deadline to vote for your favorite

Also, I'd like to remind you that this is a very good time to order a
copy of the paper edition of Volume VIII, a perfect-bound book containing
the quarterly web issues of 2006 in their entirety. It will also include
the results of the Readers' Choice Awards for haiku published in 2006.
The annual paper edition will be shipped early in April of 2007. The cost
is $16 in the United States, u.s.$18 in Canada or Mexico, and u.s.$20
elsewhere. Please make checks or money orders payable in U.S. funds to
The Heron's Nest and send to:

Wishing you all a happy and peaceful year. May your inspirations be many.
