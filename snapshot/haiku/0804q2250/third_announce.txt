Dear Friends and Readers of The Heron's Nest,

I'd like to remind those of you who have not sent in votes for the 
Readers' Choice Awards but are thinking about it, the deadline to do so 
is January 15. I'm happy to say that the turnout has been very good so 
far. Nevertheless, the more of you who take the time to review this 
year's Heron's Nest poems and to vote for your favorites, the more 
meaningful will be the results. For guidelines on how to vote, please 
navigate to: <http://www.theheronsnest.com/haiku/thn_va_announce.08.html>

Another reminder: If you are planning to purchase a copy of The Heron's 
Nest, Volume VIII, it would be helpful to me if you placed your order 
sooner than later. The collection will be coming out at the beginning 
of April but printing begins early in March. It would be great to have 
the funds for printing and mailing by then. I thank you in advance.

We in The Nest hope that each of you has been enjoying the season and 
its many festivities. May your new year bring you innumerable 
inspirations!

In gratitude and appreciation,

Christopher Herold
