Dear Friends of The Heron's Nest,

Another reminder to those of you who've not yet sent me your votes for the 
Readers' Choice Awards. The deadline is just nine days off: January 15. 
I encourage everyone to vote. There are many good reasons and here are a few:

1)  The more people who vote, the more meaningful will be the results.  

2)  Veteran poets, you who have spent many years learning the ins and outs 
of the craft and who make a point of becoming familiar with an ever-widening 
variety of forms and styles, you are more keenly aware of the depths and 
subtleties of which haiku is capable. It is important that you vote so that 
the poems honored in the Readers' Choice Awards will be rightfully meritorious.

3)  Reviewing haiku with the eyes of a judge or editor affords an exceptional 
opportunity for you poets still relatively new to the genre. You will discover 
what things about haiku seem more important to you and what things feel 
troublesome. The voting process is an excellent educational experience.

4)  And, of course, voting is a way to pay tribute to the poets whose work 
touched you most deeply.

5)  A careful selection of favorite poems may not be easy but it is almost 
always great fun!

Please do vote!
