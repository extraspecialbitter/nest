Connie Donleycott has a way with words.  Her haiku, while instantly understood by the reader, nonetheless illuminate their subjects in fresh and often pleasantly surprising ways:

finding a way 
through the forest 
winter sunlight 

The first two lines of this haiku might suggest a lost hiker or an adventurer.  The final line completes the poem in an unexpected way, revealing that it is the sunlight - and not a person - that has navigated the forest.  The result is not just a description from nature but rather the celebration of a completed journey.

Connie's keen literary eye often captures those images which would otherwise be overlooked:

New Year’s Day
three fancy toothpicks
for the avocado pit

The combination of the decoration and the discarded is a fitting vignette of the proverbial "morning after".

Connie frequently begins with a scene from nature to focus in on inanimate objects with a human connection:

blowing rain . . .
colors blend
on a garden pinwheel

winter windstorm 
a tea kettle whistles 
on the woodstove

summer garden 
the full stretch
of the hose

Sometimes nature encounters humanity directly, often with delightful results:

beachcomber
grains of sand fill
her smile lines

As I revisit Connie's haiku from Volume V, my smile lines deepen as well.
