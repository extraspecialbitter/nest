Subject: THN: The March issue

Hi B3,

Spike tells me that he'll get the new, new final draft of his commentary to me tomorrow sometime. I'm not sure if it'll need another tweak or two, or not so, I think I'll just send you everything else now. Give you a chance to get a head start on uploading the March issue. As soon as the commentary is ready, I'll send it along.

Oh yeah, and today I'll be working on the contest result announcements. I hope to have both of them to you by tonight, ready to given their own pages. As soon as those are ready, we should proof them. "Test" pages would work, and provide the editors with links, just as you do for the quarterly issues. Sound Okay?

I'm also wondering if a thumbnail jpg of each of the illustrations could be included on the Illustration result page? If that's too much work, forget it. I'll just name names.
But lemme know. 

Thanks much Big Bird,

Punchy
