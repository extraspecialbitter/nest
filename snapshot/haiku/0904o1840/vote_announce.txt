Dear Friends and Readers of The Heron’s Nest,

IT IS NOW TIME TO VOTE FOR YOUR FAVORITE POEMS FROM VOLUME IX. 

Now that the December issue has been released, we cordially invite you 
participate in the annual Readers’ Choice Awards. This is a wonderful 
opportunity to praise the poems that touched you most deeply and to pay 
tribute to the poets who penned them. Here’s how to vote:

1) After reading the December issue, go back and review the three previous 
issues, archived in “Volume Contents”: <http://www.theheronsnest.com/haiku/>
Make a list of your favorite haiku. * All haiku are eligible except those 
in the memorial sections.

2) Narrow your list to ten poems.

3) Arrange the poems in order of preference from your top choice of the 
year (#1) to your tenth choice (#10). Please include the poems themselves, 
the poets, and the issues in which the poems appeared.

4) If you wish to include comments about the poems you picked, or about 
The Heron’s Nest in general, please do. We always appreciate your feedback 
and some of the comments we receive will be included along with the voting 
results in the annual paper edition that comes out in April. 

5) Send your choices to Christopher Herold: <theheronsnest@cablespeed.com>

6) Soon there will also be a Master Index of Authors for all of Volume IX.
This should make the selection process a little bit easier.  Stay tuned for
an updated announcement once this effort is completed.

THE DEADLINE FOR VOTING IS JANUARY 15.
