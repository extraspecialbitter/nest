Subject: THN - The January Issue for proofing

Hello my friends,

I'd like to get started with the printing of this Nest early so that I
don't have a bunch to do while Vanessa and Carol's mom are here for the
next ten days. But I DO want us to be as sure as we possibly can that
there are no mistakes.

I'm sending you the entire Nest as it now stands. B3, there's no rush
for you to get this plugged in since we'll all have the copy below for
proofing purposes. Tako, Fig, and Tif, please get out your fine-tooth
combs.

I've entered the latest version of the commentary and realize that it
may not be perfectly ready yet. Please let me know asap if you see
anything amiss there.

I hope to start printing tomorrow morning. Just a couple of pages. We're
picking up Vanessa at the airport tomorrow afternoon and the day after
that we're going over to Victoria, Canada for a night. Back on Monday
evening. I'll do the bulk of the printing on Tuesday, the 23rd.

Long live The Nest!

Punchy

COMMENTARY

This delightful poem makes me smile big every time I read it. The scene
alone is enough to stir a reader^Òs imagination and evoke emotion. But
for an audience that understands the technique of layered meaning in
haiku, there is much more to be found beneath the surface.

The first line indicates the season. The word "leap" suggests either
summer or autumn, when salmon make their journeys upstream from the sea.
The element of cause and effect, often troublesome in haiku, is clearly
present in this poem, inseparable from the poet^Òs moment of insight. Yet
it is effective here. The core and strength of the haiku do not lie in
the implication that a fish leaping caused Grandpa to burst into song,
but rather in the discovery of intrinsic, unwritten reasons for this
kind of reaction. Cullen uses the juxtaposition of two vibrant images to
create an uplifting mood and invite readers to find significance on a
deeper level. In my perception, the poem is about the poet^Òs familial
relationship, humanity^Òs ancient relationship with salmon, and one man^Òs
awareness of his inherent connection with nature.
Salmon are born in freshwater streams or rivers, but they spend part of
their lives in the ocean. Swimming upstream from the sea, the adults
return to their birthplace to spawn.  Various species of this fish have
been important to humans worldwide for a very long time.  Cro-Magnon
people etched pictures of them on tools and weapons 20,000 years ago. As
major sources of food and sport, Atlantic salmon^Òs annual migrations
were heralded with great excitement in North America and Europe for
centuries.

Salmon are famous for their fighting spirit and splendid leaps. They
struggle furiously to escape the fisherman^Òs hook and will leap out of
the water many times. With immense will and strength, they battle
currents and rapids and even leap ten-foot-high waterfalls. It is no
accident that their scientific name, Salmo salar, means "the leaper."

Due to artificial dams and pollution by humans, their numbers have been
declining since the early 1600s. In spite of overfishing, man-made
obstacles, and dangers, this mighty fish continues to survive and herald
the season for those who know its ways. All of this fills Grandpa^Òs
voice. He spills over with jubilation that this creature's life cycle
continues as it has for his kindred for centuries of generations. Able
to share this wonderful moment with someone dear to him, he starts to
sing--and not merely to sing, but to sing in the brogue of his native
Ireland (a sign of deep emotion).

As the New Year begins, The Heron^Òs Nest editors thank William Cullen
Jr. for sharing his timely haiku of hope and renewal and of subtle
homage to family and ancestral roots.
