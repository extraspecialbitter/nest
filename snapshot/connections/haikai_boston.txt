Haikai Boston

You are cordially invited to our community of singers, writers, painters and sculptors at the intersection of Fenway Emerald Necklace and the Avenue of the Arts in the heart of Boston (seventh door from the Symphony Hall).

This year we run several events and gatherings geared for Japanese culture admirers, artists, connoisseurs, poets, literati, musicians and serious chatterers. 
Your $100 fee covers a conference with distinguished speakers, amazing ginko walks (Harvard Poetry Room, Japanese gardens, harbor islands and peninsulas, old Boston and Brookline). It also covers art classes (sumi-e demonstration, drawings, haiga, etc.)  at the Kaji Aso Studio quarters, tea ceremony at  the famous tea house, your poem translated into Japanese , rendered calligraphically   by Mr. Aso  and your work published.
Your poems and essays (including haiku, haibun, haiga  and renku) are welcome and special readings and  Hyde Park-style discussions and reiki will be arranged with attending poets, practitioners  and readers. Boston and Cambridge literary scenes will be on our roadmap too.
Your papers on poetry are welcome, your recitals will be scheduled, your books and artwork may be put on display and on sale (ask for details).
Your accommodations (for all budgets) will be handled by the Kaji Aso Studio staff.
You also may book (subject to the availability) $30 per person per day stay in the Commonwealth Avenue apartment conveniently located on the subway line near Boston University.
