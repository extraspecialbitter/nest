&#147;<I>A Path in the Garden</I> is a record of observations&#150; 
so many of them meditative, my favorite kind&#150; this
collection is precious, pure, having the quality of
inception&#150; the eternal moment which we come to
more as vibration and wave. Bravo!&#148;<BR><BR>

&#147;Christopher Herold takes us on a haiku path where
we see the love that goes into shaping a garden. Then
he takes us out beyond the walls and shows us where
the inspiration for gardens has come from: the forests,
the mountains and rivers. The haiku in <I>A Path in the
Garden</I> are a delight. They lead me on a path I shall
follow again and again.&#148;<BR><BR>
