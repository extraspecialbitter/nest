Jim Kacian
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nature has its seasons, and so do our human lives. Focusing on a family
album, Jim Kacian experiences a moment of heightened awareness and     
insight that links his personal life to a particular time and place in 
cultural and social history.                                           
</P>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Technology has changed. Color photography is the norm now and has been  
for some time. The black and white family pictures from his youth are   
dated in more ways than one. What was once                              
commonplace and expected seems odd, catching the author's attention and 
adding to the sense of transience the pictures must already have        
stirred. I think of my own family photographs, black and white,         
sometimes glossy, sometimes matte, right through the fifties, with color
snapshots becoming more prevalent from the mid-sixties onward.           
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A far more profound change was taking place in the United States during  
those same years.  Race was a major issue as society slowly and         
painfully moved toward integration. Jim Kacian was born in 1953. In     
Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court  
ruled that compulsory segregation in public schools denied equal        
protection under the law. In 1955 Rosa Parks was jailed for refusing to 
give up her bus seat to a white passenger. The successful bus boycott   
soon followed, as did the Civil Rights Act of 1957. By the time Kacian  
was old enough to be aware of such things, the Civil Rights Movement was
well underway. Growing up in the Sixties, he witnessed a decade of      
struggle and reform that revolutionized society. Whatever his family    
album may or may not show of the upheaval, the mature poet is surely    
conscious of it as he looks back and thinks of &#147;black and white.&#148;       
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Chances are he also thinks of the black and white of oversimplification.
Often the young are passionate, seeing right and wrong as clear         
opposites. The elders of any generation may become &#147;set in their ways,&#148; 
adhering to fixed codes, regardless of how well those codes stand up to 
tests of logic.  While practically all established standards of behavior
came into question during the Sixties, the moral judgments of that era  
seem simple and innocent compared to those of later decades.            
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Kacian's poem is compressed, seemingly artless, and infused with            
expansive energy. It appeals to the senses, the emotions, and the           
intellect. Ordinary language and readily available associations open        
large spaces for the reader to enter and explore. Just nine words link      
to a whole era and speak clearly of transience and awesome change. The      
last line brings us back to the personal, and the poem circles to its       
beginning. The family album is a concrete and meaningful presence. The      
poet's tone is somewhat detached and slightly humorous as he focuses on     
the black and white photographs, intuitively recognizing all those shades
of gray.
