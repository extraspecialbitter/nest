        <b>POPULAR POETS</b><br>
        <br>
<p>
This category represents the total number of points awarded each poet for their entire body of work in Volume XIII. The most poems an individual can have accepted in <i>The Nest</i> each year is eight. Obviously, the more 
poems a person publishes, the greater chances she or he had of attracting votes. No poet had eight poems in Volume XIII. Two poets had seven poems and three had six.
</p>
<p>
To put into perspective how well the winners did: we published poems by 250 poets during 2011 and the average total points for combined works this year was 15.
