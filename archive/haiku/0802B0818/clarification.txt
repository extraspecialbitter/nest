Dear Artists,

I'd like to add some clarification to the guidelines for The Heron's Nest 
second annual illustration contest to avoid possible confusion. I had 
mentioned in the first announcement that the theme for artwork will continue 
to be herons and/or their nests. This applies ONLY FOR THE COVER ART. 

The sectional dividers may, but do not have to include images of herons. 
The seasonal divisions should have appropriate seasonal themes, of course. 
The other sections (overview, readers' choice awards, memorials, special 
mentions, and voters's comments) we leave open to your aesthetic sensibilities.

We wish you much enjoyment in your artistic endeavors and look forward to 
receiving your submissions. Remember, the deadline is September 1.

In the spirit of haikai,

Christopher Herold
