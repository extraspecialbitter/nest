The Second Annual<br><i>Heron&#8217;s Nest</i> Illustration Contest
</font></h2>
</center>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
The Editors and staff of <i>The Heron&#8217;s Nest</i> invite you to submit 
samples of your artwork to consider for the second annual print edition of 
<i>The Heron&#8217;s Nest</i> (Volume VIII).</p>

<p>
The art may be in any medium, including photographs. Work intended for the 
cover may be in color and will be printed in color (if selected). Sectional 
art can be submitted in color but will be printed in black and white.</p>

<p>
The cover theme must depict either herons or their nests. Sectional dividers 
need not include images of herons. Seasonal divisions should, of course, have 
themes appropriate to them. The other sections (overview, readers&#8217;s 
choice awards, memorials, special mentions, and voters&#8217;s comments) we 
leave open to your aesthetic sensibilities.</p>

<p>
The dimensions of the cover will be the same as the printed <i>Nest</i> has 
been in the past (5 1/2&#8221; x 8 1/2&#8221;). The selected art may be 
presented entirely on the front cover or it may wrap around to the back cover 
(as it did for Volume VII). Some small amount of sizing may be necessary to 
maximize effect. If so, a proof will be sent to the winner for approval. Only 
original works that have not been published will be considered and all rights 
to the artwork will return to the artist once Volume VIII has been printed.</p>

<p>
PLEASE SUBMIT SIX COPIES OF EACH PIECE OF ART</p>

<p>
DEADLINE: in-hand September 1, 2006</p>

<p>
All entries are to be sent to Christopher Herold, 816 Taft Street, Port 
Townsend, WA 98368. Judges will be the editors and staff of <i>The 
Heron&#8217;s Nest</i> and a professional artist yet to be selected.</p>

<p>
Entries will not be returned without your request. If you wish your work 
returned, please include a SASE for that purpose.</p>

<p>
We wish you much enjoyment in your artistic endeavors and look forward to 
receiving your submissions. Remember, the deadline is September 1.</p>

<p>
In the spirit of haikai,</p>

<p>
Christopher Herold</p>
