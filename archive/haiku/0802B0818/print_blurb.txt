PRAISE FOR THE PRINT EDITION OF THE HERON^ÒS NEST ^× VOLUME VII

Dear Friends and Haiku Fans,

Fortunately, I had a good many more copies of Volume VII printed than were initially ordered. I still have a good supply too, but there^Òs a steady stream of orders coming in so, if you are thinking about buying a copy of the paper edition, don^Òt delay too long. And if you^Òre vacillating, read some of these enthusiastic responses we^Òve been receiving from subscribers. They just might convince you that it would be nice to have a copy too.

With much gratitude,

Christopher Herold

^Ó^Åeasily the most beautiful haiku journal I have ever held in my hands--was very moving.^Ô ^×Allan Burns   

^Ó^Åit^Òs been so enjoyable revisiting old favourites from the site, while other haiku seem to come into their own in this medium. The format and layout really allow the haiku to breathe, to resonate. It is a fitting celebration of all the dedication and hard work that goes into The Nest and it is certainly a volume that I will dip into often.^Ô ^×John Barlow  

^ÓI^Òm very pleased with the new and first annual publication of The Heron^Òs Nest. It is lovely! What a treasure! A deep gasho to all of you who worked so long and faithfully to bring it to fruition, and into our arts. The book feels as if we^Òve truly come of age!^Ô  ^×Kay F. Anderson   

^Ó^Åthe combination of the Web as periodical delivery and a nice bound volume as the keeper is a great way to be doing what you are doing.^Ô ^×David Noble 

^Ó^Åa lovely production ^× looks good and nice to hold. Congratulations!!^Ô ^×Patricia Prime  

^ÓNara and I both extend our thanks and deep appreciation to you and all the editors of the Heron's Nest for maintaining and preserving the spirit of haiku through this excellent journal.^Ô ^×Robert and Nara Bauer 

^ÓThe Heron's Nest is beautiful.  I love how the beak of the heron on the front cover leads the reader to open the book. Once opened, it^Òs hard to close.^Ô ^×Connie Donleycott 

^ÓWhat a GREAT publication - big ups (as they say round here) to all involved. It looks good (fantastic cover), is packed with poems and information and is a thoroughly good read. Congratulations, back slaps and cheers!^Ô ^×Sandra Simpson 

^ÓAll I can say is WOW! An amazing production in every detail. I must say I'm really swept away by it. Truly awesome.^Ô ^×Scott Metz  

^ÓI can't tell you how much pleasure it is to hold in my hands and read your inaugural annual volume of The Heron's Nest for 2005. My mom has missed the monthly hard copy and is looking forward to her own copy of the new version of the Nest.^Ô ^×Yvonne Cabalona  

^ÓI opened it. I felt the weight of it. All I could think was "It is so handsome". It is! You have provided your people with hours and hours of bliss. The cover is gorgeous. In fact every illustration is quite exceptional. The layout is clear and unassuming. The paper luxurious.^Ô ^×Kirsty Karkow  

^ÓI have just received my first edition of the NEW Heron's Nest^ÅIt is beautiful and so rich in every way. It has a lovely heft and wonderful feel, great artwork and, of course, the cream of the haiku writer's art. It is a publication of true beauty and great worth.^Ô ^×Mary Lee McClure
