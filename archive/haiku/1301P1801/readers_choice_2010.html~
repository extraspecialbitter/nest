The Editors and Web Master of <i>The Heron&#8217;s Nest</i> are pleased to announce the results of the Readers&#8217; Choice Awards 
for favorite poems and poets featured in Volume XII, 2010.
</p>
<p>
76 voters provided us with their top ten poems from Volume XII. We are very grateful indeed that so many readers took the time to revisit the 485 
eligible poems we published last year and made their top selections known to us.
</p>
<p>
The print edition of Volume XII, to be mailed in April, will include the contents of all four quarterly issues, the entire awards report, with 
commentary, a section of special mention poems, and a generous sample of comments by readers on individual poems and on the voting process, plus 
winning entries from the illustration contest. For information on how to order, please visit

        <b>POPULAR POETS</b><br>
        <br>
<p>
This category represents the total number of points awarded each poet for their entire body of work in Volume XII. The most poems an individual can have accepted in The Nest each year is eight. Obviously, the more poems a person publishes, the greater chances he or she has of attracting votes. One poet had eight poems published during 2010 and one had seven. Seven poets had six poems published.</p>
<p>To put into perspective how well the winners did: the average total points for combined works this year was 24.
