Hail Boston Bird!

And hello again to you species of a more southerly habitat.

Here is the November Nest, ready to upload into the standby
mode so we can all feast our eyes upon in search of mutant
minnows.

Triple B, I'm sorry to not have responded to your note of the 19th
in which you provided a view of how THN would look with
locations added under the poets' names on each of the pages
of haiku. Or maybe I did respond. My juggling routine has
been a bit shaky of late. I apologize. At any rate, I DO like
what you've accomplished Paul. I think Tako's observation that
the spacing could be a bit better is a good one.  Perhaps there
could be slightly more space between the poem and the poets'
names and less space between the names and location. Also,
names and locations should be included with the three poems
on the EC page. The home page is fine as it is (just the poem
and the poet's name).

One more thing. I feel strongly that we should wait for the
January issue, Vol. V, Number 1, to make this change. It seems
to me a more appropriate time to make a change as noticeable
as this one will be.

Please let me know how these ideas and opinions sit with you.
And thanks again Paul for all your web magic.

Now then, here's the November Nest!

Your West Coast Buddy, Punchy T. Heron

                COMMENTARY

Concision. Classic construction. Concrete imagery. Credibility. They are
all here. However, while these four qualities almost guarantee an
adequate haiku, they are elemental and can be found in almost any haiku
crafted by an experienced writer. Something more makes a poem much
better than adequate; something more earns this one unusually high marks
from each Heron's Nest editor. Evocative juxtaposition and haunting
musicality are also here, and they are the key to its resonance.

This haiku reflects the vast difference in the time spans of two
infinitely significant events: A whale population's journey occurs only
twice a year, while the tide changes twice daily. The sense of a long
passage of time is reflected in the rhythm of the poem. A migration may
last for several months. The repeated long sound of "a" in the first
line and again at the end suggests a long-term process rather than an
event that occurs suddenly. This assonance, coupled with the cadence of
the second and third lines, imparts a song-like quality, so that the
words seem to fade away rather than come to a sudden stop. Here is a
haiku that begs to be read aloud.

The unspoken certainty that human and nonhuman life are interwoven lies
in the joining of these precise images. The sense of immediacy is
another valuable quality. It is easy for me to imagine the awestruck
author, oblivious of time, watching the journey of whales. At some
point, while still held in the wonder of their passage, the poet notices
that his footprints and those of his companion(s) are disappearing with
the rising tide. Along with his sudden awareness of this natural
juxtaposition of events, comes the flash of insight. The poet lives the
resonance of the moment.

The visual imagery alone is beautiful, but I also perceive the poem as a
rich metaphor with subtle foreshadowing. The first line fills me with
longing to see migrating whales in person, and I am reminded that their
numbers are diminishing. The implicit message of "all our
footprints/wash away" leaves me breathless. When the whales are all
gone, so might the rest of us be too---or at least well on our way out.

Yet I dare to hope. Under legal protection, the gray whale population
made an extraordinary recovery from its near extinction in the early
1900s. It is the only baleen whale to have recovered from commercial
whaling, though it took nearly 60 years. Still, the gray whales have
come back, and they migrate in large numbers.

In addition to presenting an aesthetically pleasing haiku, the author
invites readers to venture within and explore its connotations  Thank
you, paul m.; I am richer for the journey.
