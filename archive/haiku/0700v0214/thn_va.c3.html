            hot afternoon<br>
            the squeak of my hands<br>
            on my daughter&#8217;s coffin 
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>THE WAY IT HAPPENED<br>
              <br>
              by Lenard D. Moore 
            <p> The afternoon sweltered with humidity two days before summer began 
              and one day before Father’s day. After our daughter Maiisha LaShawn 
              Moore’s funeral on June 19, 2004, we were driven in procession to 
              Carolina Biblical Gardens. Once we emptied the long, dark blue family 
              car, and others got out of their glinting cars and SUVs, we walked 
              to the green tent and sat in the metal chairs. My wife Lynn, other 
              family members, and I were handed white roses. I was the first person 
			  to lay a rose on my daughter’s coffin, which was also white.  I planted my hands 
              on the coffin. Somehow they slid down, giving off a squeak. I had 
              never heard such a sound. It was as if my hands screamed. I didn’t 
              know my hands were moist. All I knew was the sound—that awful squeak 
              pierced a door into the house of memory. I kept thinking about that 
              squeak, which resonated so clearly in the cemetery hush. I kept 
              thinking about how I considered carrying my daughter’s coffin from 
              the hearse to the gravesite, even though family members insisted 
              I let the pallbearers carry her. At that point, I had felt my daughter 
              would have wanted me to be one of the six pallbearers. When the 
              family car pulled off to take us in procession to my brother and 
              sister-in-law’s house for the repast, I turned toward the window 
              on my right and saw the coffin lowering into the earth. I didn’t 
              want to leave the gravesite so soon. I was clinging to memories 
              and to a haiku Maiisha wrote when she was only six or seven years 
              old. I still remember that night in the late 1980s when we were 
              riding on Barwell Road and Maiisha recited her haiku to me: </p>
            <blockquote> 
			&nbsp;&nbsp;the dark rock-road<br>
              a car coming down it,<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;me and my daddy<br>
              <br>
              &#8212;&nbsp;Maiisha L. Moore </blockquote>
            <p> I still remember a morning in the mid 1980s when we were leaving 
              our apartment on North Hills Drive to take our daughter to camp 
              and from there to go to work. I remember the haiku my wife Lynn 
              wrote on that occasion: </p>
            <blockquote> 
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;morning fog<br>
              my daughter dropped off at camp<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fumes of city bus<br>
              <br>
              &#8212;&nbsp;Lynn G. Moore </blockquote>
            <p> To further illustrate the meaning of family for us, I might go 
              back even further. I still remember witnessing my wife breast-feeding 
              our daughter in private and in public: </p>
            <blockquote> 
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a black woman<br>
              breast-feeding her infant&nbsp;&#8212;<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the autumn moon<br>
              <br>
              &#8212;&nbsp;Lenard D. Moore </blockquote>
            <p> How I remember all those Friday evenings and nights in the 1980s, 
              1990s, and the early 2000s when Lynn, Maiisha and I went out to 
              dinner and then to the movie theater. How I remember the shopping 
              trips to Charlotte and Potomac Mills; the vacations to Atlanta, 
              Savannah, Myrtle Beach, Atlantic Beach, Bluefield, Jacksonville, 
              Washington, DC, and the Bahamas. </p>
            <p> The three poems above all appeared in Chapter Two, “It’s a Family 
              Affair,” of the book <em>CATCH THE FIRE: A Cross-Generational Anthology 
              of Contemporary African-American Poetry</em>. Perhaps, when one reads 
              that Chapter Two title, he or she will hear Sly Stone singing those 
              words the way he did more than three decades ago. Maybe one will 
              also hear Sister Sledge singing “We Are Family” as they did so eloquently 
              more than twenty-five years ago. I don’t think I could say anything 
              more about our own family bond. </p>
