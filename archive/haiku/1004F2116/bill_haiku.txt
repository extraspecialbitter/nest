Poems by William J. Higgingson
Published in The Heron’s Nest

early morning
glue sets in the shade
of the old shed


summer dawn—
light around the windows
as at grandmother's


early warmth
in the backyard a flicker
pokes among rocks


thump and screech–
the long freight pulls out
in robin's song


that dull gleam
through the hazy park–
a playhouse window

restless pigeons —
gentle words from a clerk
bring a hint of tears


one maple leaf . . .
end over end on the sand
without a trace


crescent moon
would I look at the clouds
without it?


everywhere this morning
maple keys soaking in
the gentle rain


how to tell
of the myriad rich browns?
pin-oak leaves
