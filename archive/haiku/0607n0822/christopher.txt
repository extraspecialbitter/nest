COMMENTARY

the heat
two boys take it
outside

Paul Pfleuger

In just seven words, this haiku conjures up a myriad images. As the
oldest of three brothers and the father of three sons, my mind
immediately races through memories old and new. My most vivid
recollection, however, is far more recent^×as well as somewhat
embarrassing. A former manager once attempted to motivate me with a
highly public, utterly unprofessional tirade. My response to him was
even-tempered but stern: I assured him that if he ever raised his voice
to me again that we would "step outside and settle it like men." So here
are two questions to which most of us as colloquial English-speakers
already know the answers: what is "it," and what does it mean to "take
it outside?"

Paul Pfleuger helps us to answer this question by establishing the scene
with two simple words, "the heat." We know this right away to be a
reference to temperature, but implications abound: among them tension,
impatience and discomfort. For this reason, we understand that the "it"
in the second line is not a barking dog or a burning frying pan. "It" is
a boiling over of emotions verging on physical confrontation, and as it
is often blind to surroundings or circumstances, it is best relocated
where it is least likely to cause injury or damage. (a home or
establishment).

The "two boys" in the second line could be soldiers from a crowded
barracks or bar patrons who've had a few too many, but I prefer a more
literal reading: that two pre-adolescent males have somehow crossed from
the land of "playing nice" to the less hospitable terrain of "playing
rough." I recall my uncle dealing with this situation by refusing to
intervene in the quarrels between my two cousins, but rather letting
them fight in the backyard until one of them returned to the house
crying^×usually from a wounded pride more than any physical injury. The
"winner" of the fight was then punished by my uncle, the lesson being
that no one really wins such a fight between brothers.

In these boyhood skirmishes the stakes are usually not very high^×more
often than not the two participants will not remember what started the
disagreement. So while not much may be resolved, tension is released
instead of suppressed, and the two boys are friends again.

I can^Òt help comparing this fraternal struggle to a typical summer
weather pattern: heat and humidity build throughout the course of the
day, culminating in a violent but brief thunderstorm, after which cooler
temperatures prevail. It is this post-storm feeling of refreshment^×
however fleeting^×that remains as I read and re-read Paul Pfleuger^Òs fine
haiku.
