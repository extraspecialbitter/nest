Dear Friends and Nest Readers,

One last reminder to those of you who would like to vote for your favorite 
poems from Volume VI.  The deadline is tomorrow (Saturday) at midnight. 
This is an excellent opportunity to revisit some fine haiku and to make 
a difference in the outcome of the awards. 

An index of all Volume VI poets and their respective haiku can be found at:
<http://www.theheronsnest.com/haiku/thn_va.index.06.html>.

With my best wishes, as ever,

Christopher Herold
