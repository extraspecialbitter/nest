TIME TO VOTE

Dear Readers,

With this December issue, Volume VI is complete. We cordially invite you to
participate in the sixth annual Valentine Awards by voting for your favorite
Heron's Nest poems from the past year. Here's how to cast your vote:

*  Review all Volume VI poems. You can read the entire volume at our web-site
by navigating to the "Volume VI Poets Index" page at:
<http://www.theheronsnest.com/haiku/thn_va_index.06.html>.
From there you'll find all eleven issues with their respective haiku pages
and indexes of poets. If you are using the paper edition to review the poems
of 2004 but are missing particular issues, there are plenty in supply. Just
order them from Christopher Herold (addresses below).

*  Choose up to ten of your favorite haiku and list them in your order of
preference. All poems in Volume VI are eligible except those included in
memorials or written by the Heron's Nest staff. And, of course, you may not
vote for your own work.

*  Send your list of up to ten poems (in order of preference!), or any
questions you may have about the Valentine Awards, to Christopher Herold:
e-mail: <theheronsnest@cablespeed.com>
postal address: 816 Taft St., Port Townsend, WA 98368

VOTING DEADLINE

Midnight, January 15, 2005

In other deadline-related news, those who wish their haiku to be considered 
for the March 2005 issue should send them in by December 15, 2004.
