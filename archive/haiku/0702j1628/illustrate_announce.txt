The First Annual

Heron's Nest Illustration Contest

The Editors and staff of The Heron's Nest invite you to submit samples 
of your artwork to be considered for the first annual print edition of 
The Heron's Nest (Volume VII). 

You can enter two categories, COVER ART and/or SECTIONAL ART.

COVER ART: The work in this category must focus on herons or in some way 
imply their presence. Impressionistic works are acceptable. 

SECTIONAL ART: The work in this category will be used to separate each of 
the quarterly issues and the awards issue. There are five possible themes: 
each of the four seasons and a non-seasonal work that somehow heralds the 
special feel of an awards presentation. 

The art may be in any two-dimensional medium. It may be submitted in color, 
but it is important that you know that all work will be reproduced in 
black-and-white. The dimensions of the The Heron's Nest will be the same 
as they have been in the past (5 1/2"  x  8 1/2") The masthead and volume 
number will appear on the cover and the issue number and date will appear 
on each sectional page. Proofs will be sent to the winners for approval. 
Only original works that have not been published will be considered. All 
rights to the art will return to the artist once Volume VII has been printed.

PLEASE SUBMIT SIX PHOTO-COPIES OF EACH PIECE OF ART in the dimensions: 
5" wide x 8" tall. You may submit a maximum of five entries in the first 
category (cover art) and up to five entries in each of the themes of the 
second category (sectional art).

DEADLINE: in-hand November 1, 2005

All entries should be sent to Christopher Herold: 
816 Taft Street, Port Townsend, WA  98368. 

JUDGES: David Noble, a highly-regarded graphic artist and book-cover designer, 
along with editors and staff of The Heron's Nest.
