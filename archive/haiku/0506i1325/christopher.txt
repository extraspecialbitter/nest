Hiya Boston Bird,

I have for you the June Nest all spruced up and ready for uploading.
At your lesha of course.

I hope things are going well in your neck of the woods. Tako is
up in Maine for Meghan's graduation. Man is he ever proud! And
for damned good reason. Meg's last grades were straight A's . . . again.

Our daughter is in Hawaii for four months. She's going to a school
that will give her credentials to be an esthetician. Yeah, say WHAT?!
Not a bad environment to be going to school I must say. IF she can
keep her mind focused. Maui can be ever so distracting.

So . . . here be the June issue. Have at it!

Punchy

COMMENTARY

Past and present. Carolyn Hall tugs us into history, a trip of at least
150 years.  Still found in a few places, the horrible practice of
slavery that is as old as human society was finally outlawed in the
English-speaking part of the world during the 19th Century.

The river of Carolyn^Òs experience is itself rich in symbolism. In
Colonial times, rivers were central to transportation and commerce. The
poet sees the willow tree in the present, leaves draping pliantly into
the water from characteristically bent branches. It is a languid scene
of late spring on into summer. The last two lines of the poem
(especially with the word "tug") are expressive and evocative and would
complement many a haiku setting. Discussing the haikai poetics of Basho,
Haruo Shirane writes: "The suggestion here is that poetry must emerge
from the interaction between the immediate experience based on direct
observation, which provided new perspectives and approaches but which
alone was insufficient to create lasting poetry, and the broader
experience embodied in the utamakura, in the associations of the poetic
place, which bore the collective memory."* Carolyn has spurred emotion
of such power that it could overcome many haiku. Her skill with language
and its delivery has transported me to the place of her insight and
renewed my own personal experiences as well as my cultural memory.

Carolyn may have visited one of the Caribbean islands once colonized by
European nations, or toured a historic plantation of the Southern United
States. Last fall, I spent part of a day at Montpelier, the family home
of James Madison, the fourth President, and author of most of the US
Constitution. He lived in upland Virginia about a day by horse from
Thomas Jefferson^Òs Monticello. Around 1720, Madison^Òs grandfather
Ambrose was the first to saw a tree or plow the land there, or rather,
it was his slaves who did the work of the plantation. Some farmed,
others served in the main house or assisted in James Madison^Òs smithy,
manufacturing nails for hard currency. The wooden cabins of the slave
quarters are long gone.  Archaeologists have found their sites and, at
some distance in what is now horse pasture, the slave cemetery. I saw it
outlined by tape in research grids. I stood there alone, out in the
sun.  There were no benches. A few hundred yards away, President Madison
has a stone marker in the "white" cemetery. If any, there was only a
wooden marker for the burial place of a slave. All trace of the
individual is now lost.

The slave times are past, yet the river, the land, and the poet remain.
Oscar Hammerstein (in the Broadway musical "Show Boat") has a lyric
referring to the Mississippi River [as "He"]: "He don^Òt plant taters, He
don^Òt plant cotton, an^Ò dem dat plants ^Ñem is soon forgotten. But Ol^Ò
Man River, He jes^Ò keeps rollin^Ò along."
