Hi Everyone!

We done done it again! The March Nest has now been selected, arranged,
commented upon. The "Friends of The Heron's Nest" has been updated, and
the whole kit 'n' kaboodle entered into the web-template. So, I now give
it to you for uploading to the scrutiny site and for careful proofing.

Well done y'all! Now I'll start setting up the paper edition template so
I can start printing once the
proofing is over. Hopefully we can do that by the 25th. This is a short
month and I need a good
three days to get all the printing and assembly accomplished. As it is,
I'll be getting it out on the
first instead of the 28th. That's okay though. We'd only be officially
late if I were to mail as late
as the 8th. Our precedent is mailing on the last day of the month
though. That's what people will
remember.

Okay, nuff said. Here's the March Nest . . .

Hugs from Punchyland

               COMMENTARY

village square-
old faces borrowing angles
from the stone

                    H. F. Noyes


The poet speaks of angles in a poem that is aurally and visually
angular.
The words "square" and "angles," the sharp cut at the end of the first
line, and the sparseness of all the words save one^×these factors lend
physical and lingual shape. Use of the present participle is the key to
the poem's musicality. Rounder in pronunciation than the remaining words
and having a third syllable, "borrowing" slows the pace. I immediately
read "village square--" aloud several times to enjoy its rhythm, and
quickly became fascinated by the implication of the last two lines.

With apparent ease and a perfect economy of speech, H. F. Noyes
describes an intriguing occurrence, one that is representative of
humanity's symbiotic relationship with its surroundings. Though the
animal kingdom was the first to participate, humans are major players in
this ancient and continuing phenomenon. With one word, "borrowing," the
poet sums it up. Not only do our creative outward expressions reflect
our inner states of being, we seem to take on the appearance of our
milieu, whether it be artifactual or nature's creation.

Human faces and their surroundings show the effects of time and the
elements. Nowhere is this more evident than among people who spend much
of their lives out of doors. I first began to notice this as a child
growing up in a South Georgia farming community. Working long hours
season after season, in relentless heat under a glaring sky, the people
who worked the farms lost the bloom of youth by the time they reached
their early twenties. The lean, wiry men and women became more sun-dried
with each passing year. By middle age, their faces and necks had become
leathery and as furrowed as the plowed fields, and all those who stayed
lean developed a certain angularity.

In many traditional Greek towns, the stone-built houses, stone walls,
and cobblestone streets have been preserved and are still in use.  I
imagine H. F. Noyes as he strolls through a village square, absorbing
the sunlit beauty of whitewashed stone, red tile roofs, and large
earthenware pots spilling with colorful blooms.  Perhaps he sits
agreeably among some of the elder residents, men and women of
indeterminate age, who live in the houses their ancestors built. He sees
that the faces of his companions, like the ancient buildings, reveal the
essence of the village.

Whether we experience it in a mountain burg, a small farming town, a
fishing village, or a bustling city, most of us will be able to share
the poet's insight.  In his excellent book,still here*, H. F. Noyes
shares a comment from a letter he wrote to vincent tripi: "Growing old
gracefully is giving back to life what was never ours." With "village
square," the poet seems to be showing us that we are no more separate
from our habitats than any other species.
