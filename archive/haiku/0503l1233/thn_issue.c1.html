&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
H. F. Noyes
</p>The poet speaks of angles 
            in a poem that is aurally and visually angular. The words &#8220;square&#8221; 
            and &#8220;angles,&#8221; the sharp cut at the end of the first line, 
            and the sparseness of all the words save one&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;these 
            factors lend physical and lingual shape. Use of the present participle 
            is the key to the poem&#8217;s musicality. Rounder in pronunciation 
            than the remaining words and having a third syllable, &#8220;borrowing&#8221; 
            slows the pace. I immediately read &#8220;village square&#8221; aloud 
            several times to enjoy its rhythm, and quickly became fascinated by 
            the implication of the last two lines. 
            <p></p>
            With apparent ease and a perfect economy of speech, H. F. Noyes describes 
            an intriguing occurrence, one that is representative of humanity&#8217;s 
            interactive relationship with its surroundings. Though the animal 
            kingdom was the first to participate, humans are major players in 
            this ancient and continuing phenomenon. The poet sums it up with one 
            word: &#8220;borrowing.&#8221; Not only do our creative outward expressions 
            reflect our inner states of being, we seem to take on the appearance 
            of our milieu, whether it be artifactual or nature&#8217;s creation. 
            <p></p>
            All things, including humans, show the effects of time and the elements. 
            Nowhere is this more evident than among people who spend much of their 
            lives out of doors. I first began to notice this as a child growing 
            up in a South Georgia farming community. Working long hours season 
            after season, in relentless heat under a glaring sky, the people who 
            worked the farms lost the bloom of youth by the time they reached 
            their early twenties. The lean, wiry men and women became more sun-dried 
            with each passing year. By middle age, their faces and necks had become 
            leathery and as furrowed as the plowed fields, and all those who stayed 
            lean developed a certain angularity. 
            <p></p>
            In many traditional Greek towns, the stone-built houses, stone walls, 
            and cobblestone streets have been preserved and are still in use. 
            I imagine H. F. Noyes as he strolls through a village square, absorbing 
            the sunlit beauty of whitewashed stone, red tile roofs, and large 
            earthenware pots spilling with colorful blooms. Perhaps he sits agreeably 
            among some of the elder residents, men and women of indeterminate 
            age, who live in the houses their ancestors built. He sees that the 
            faces of his companions, like the ancient buildings, reveal the essence 
            of the village. 
            <p></p>
            Whether we experience it in a mountain burg, a small farming town, 
            a fishing village, or a bustling city, most of us will be able to 
            share the poet&#8217;s insight. In his excellent book, still here*, 
            H. F. Noyes shares a comment from a letter he wrote to vincent tripi: 
            &#8220;Growing old gracefully is giving back to life what was never 
            ours.&#8221; With &#8220;village square,&#8221; the poet seems to 
            be showing us that we are no more separate from our habitats than 
            any other species. <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></TD>
