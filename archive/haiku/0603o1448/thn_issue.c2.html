              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stones that have dried<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among those that haven&#8217;t 
            </p>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Stevenson 
            </p>
            <p> What a surprise to again find myself writing commentary for a 
              poem by John Stevenson. And so soon! Well . . . not such a surprise 
              really. What is it about this man&#8217;s way with words that time and 
              again tweaks us into perceiving familiar things in fresh and profound 
              ways? </p>
            <p> In the role of reader, I stepped into John&#8217;s shoes (though he 
              may not have been wearing any), to allow the images he presented 
              to stimulate my own thoughts and emotions. In other words, I made 
              the moment my own. As a writer, I&#8217;ll now draw on my own experiences 
              to express (in the form of a haibun) what I intuit to be the core 
              of John&#8217;s fine poem. </p>
            <i><blockquote><p> The sun, having floated free of the horizon, now seems to hover 
              in a clear sky. The chill of early morning is gone yet there's no 
              one but me on the beach. </p>
              <p> I am weary. The last few weeks of work have been exceedingly 
                stressful. As deadlines loomed, equipment broke down. Progress 
                slowed and frustrations were vented. The home front has also been 
                hectic. There&#8217;s been a steady stream of appointments: doctor, 
                dentist, tax consultant, audiologist, opthamology, and car mechanic. 
                There have been several dinner parties, two poetry readings, and 
                a jam session. Friends just had a baby, another friend has died. 
                For the most part, these are now things of the past. Finally, 
                I have a little time to myself, yet some emotions linger and I 
                feel hollow, filled with echoes. I&#8217;m at a low ebb. A breeze 
                has sprung up. The pungent smell of the paper mill mingles with 
                those of brine and seaweed. The Klikitat ferry rounds Point Hudson 
                on its way to Whidbey Island. A gull flaps up from a buoy. The 
                bell clangs, just once. (C.H.) </p>
            <p> low tide&nbsp;&#8212;<br>
              stones that have dried<br>
              among those that haven&#8217;t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J. 
              S.) </p></blockquote></i>
            <p> My experience of John&#8217;s inspired moment is just that, my own. 
              You will come to it differently. Writing a haibun to accompany his 
              poem was illuminating; it increased my empathy for the moment John 
              shares with us. You might enjoy doing the same. </p>
            <p> The practice of reading and writing haiku takes us through unending 
              stages of development. With tenacity, we can reach a stage that 
              R. H. Blyth described this way: &#8220;At the moment of composition or 
              appreciation, there is no distinction between inner and outer. Life 
              runs so freely between them that we perceive things by introspection, 
              and our experiences of the &#8217;outer&#8217; world have the same immediacy, 
              validity, and certainty as have states of pure &#8217;self&#8217; consciousness.&#8221; 
              Anais Nin put it another way: &#8220;We don&#8217;t see the world as it is; 
              we see it as we are.&#8221; We may not always be aware of this while writing 
              our own haiku, but if we aren&#8217;t aware of it while reading other 
              poets&#8217; work, we are likely to miss a substantial part of what makes 
              haiku so special. Ideally, the poet, the object of inspiration, and the reader become
inseparable.                                                        </p>
            <p> John Stevenson made it easy for me to take his place on the beach. 
              His sandals fit so well I don&#8217;t feel them&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;the sign of an expert 
              craftsman! </p>
