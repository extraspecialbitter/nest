Hi my Bostonian Buddy!

I feel a little out of touch lately. My fault entirely. So sorry.
I've spoken with both Tif, and Fig on the phone (about a
week ago I think). SO nice to hear their voices! And I intended
to call both you and Tako too but got caught up in all sorts of
other things. Sigh . . . But I SHALL call you both soon. Promise.

Now then, matters at hand! Here is the April Nest, ready for you
to upload it to a private scrutiny page for proofing purposes.
Obviously it's all going to everybody anyway, just in case you
can't get to the inputting for a few days.

Something else I'd like to inquire about . . . BBB, you did such
a super job with commentaries for the Valentine Awards issue,
I wonder if you'd like to join the rest of us in the regular
rotation? We'd LOVE to have your voice in the mix. That would
mean doing commentary about twice a year. Whatchasay? You
don't have to leap in right away. By August would be cool if you
feel so inclined . . . I speak for all of us on this, by the way.
Right mighty herons of the editorial division?

Hmmm . . . I thought I had one more item to bring up . . . and
now I've spaced it! Darn! Oh well, below is the April Nest. If I
think of what it was I wanted to say, I'll just drip you another note.

Bye for now, and thank you!

Punchy

COMMENTARY

 It is most unusual to use a proper name in a haiku. Since a majority of
readers would be unlikely to know who the person is, there would seem to
be an unbridgeable gap between the poet and the reader, which of course,
runs contrary to haiku sensibility. Yet this poem is proof that a proper
noun can be effective when obviously symbolic of a close personal
relationship. That Francine refers to Bernard by name makes this poem
far more poignant than if she were to have written impersonally of
"him."

 "Even the jays," (brash and careless as they are) sense that something
has changed. Where there^Òs usually food to be found, there^Òs none. But
this haiku isn^Òt about birds. It isn^Òt about Bernard either, nor is it
just about Francine, who is now facing a void in her life. Even the
emptiness she feels (the emotional crux of this poem) tells but half the
story. By themselves, each of these elements say little of what the poet
wishes to express. By putting them together, however, Francine Porad has
painted a vivid picture of indisputable truth: the only constant is
change and to survive we must be adaptable.

 The emptiness that the jays discover is only that in a feeding station.
The poet describes emptiness felt as a result of profound loss. Even
though there are readers who don^Òt know anything of Francine Porad, of
her life and her works, they cannot help but glean that Bernard is
someone important to her and that he is gone. Those who do know her
probably know that Bernard was Francine^Òs husband and that he recently
passed away.

 To one degree or another, relationships involve dependencies and
compromises. Some are so subtle that they aren^Òt noticed until one
partner is no longer physically present. The recognition of Bernard^Òs
absence accentuates the fact that he continues to exist in Francine^Òs
life. They were married for over 50 years, so memories of him are sure
to arise again and again, often quite unexpectedly, and sometimes in odd
places.

 Along with "empty," "even," and "Bernard," the word "seed" is important
to this haiku. Through its use, Bernard is seen to have been a provider.
Not only did he provide for his family, he routinely fed the birds. What
power Francine creates by juxtaposing Bernard^Òs absence (emptiness) with
something so full of life as a seed! In this poem, seed can be thought
of as the physical, intellectual, and emotional nutrients for a
relationship. The bird house is not the only house that is empty. It is
interesting to note that for as long as we^Òve been reading Francine
Porad^Òs published works, we^Òve seen "Mercer Island" under her name.
Discerning readers will note that Francine now lives in Bellevue.
Strangely, this new address can be read as an underscoring of her haiku.

 Ultimately, this poem is about change, and the spirit necessary to
adjust to ever-changing circumstances. Even at a difficult time of loss,
Francine Porad is so sensitively attuned that she recognizes her
feelings objectively, and has the courage to express those feelings
through art and poetry. This makes me happy. It tells me that she is
indeed thriving.
