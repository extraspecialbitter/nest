I am saddened to learn of Bob&#8217;s passing. I&#8217;ve long enjoyed his poetry and got to meet him at the Haiku North America 
conference in Evanston, Illinois in 1999. I still remember that he wrote a haiku back then about how, under fluorescent lights, 
bald heads all gleam differently. Bob had a wonderful, self-effacing humor, perfect for haiku, and a big, generous heart.

The lilacs bloom in great profusion. Robert would have loved the vibrancy of colors and scents that decorate us this year. It was a 
cold spell that turned our yards, our gardens, our spring into a kaleidoscope of beauty. And it was in this cold spell that we 
discovered the truth of all life . . . to every thing there is a season.

The following poem was the result of a moment I shared with Bob on the first day I met him. It was written during a ginko at the 
Bloedel Estate on Bainbridge Island.
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>

a small flower<br>
bends our knees
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
I loved Bob&#8217;s wisdom and quick wit. In an on-the-spot response to one of my poems he wrote:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
sitting in the swing<br>
to remember how it was . . .<br>
what to do with my legs
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Bob was a dear friend and I will miss him very much.

I have fond memories of Bob. He always seemed to have a twinkle in his eye, and he gave good bear hugs. He was especially kind to me 
at the time of the HNA meeting in Portland, where he functioned as my chauffeur in addition to everything else he was doing for the 
local group. While I have been thinking about Bob, I remembered how impressed I always was about his attention to and fascination 
with small happenings and objects.</p>
<p><blockquote>
So large a presence<br>
yet his delight in small things<br>
&#8220;a pinch or a smidgen&#8221;<br>

At my first Haiku Northwest meeting, early in 1999, poets sat in a circle around Francine Porad&#8217;s living room reading haiku. 
When my turn came I read the first line of my offering and paused. Just then Bob, who was sitting beside me, let loose a thunderous 
sneeze. I jumped and my mind went blank. Francine couldn&#8217;t suppress a giggle, which, of course, was contagious. Soon we were 
all laughing, even Bob. He was both notorious and beloved for such sneezes. Strange, but even that sound plays a part in my missing 
him.<br>
<br>
I especially appreciated the Quaker memorial service arranged for Bob. It took place in an old meeting hall that seemed to be 
steeped in the shared insights of countless Friends meetings. The appreciative and respectful silence embraced us, significantly 
intensifying a sense of the space once occupied by our dear friend. Voices blossomed from that silence, clear, heartfelt, and 
filled with emotion. Bob&#8217;s family stood to share their memories, one after another, each of them vivacious and entertaining 
even in their obvious grief. More than a few folks spoke of or recited haiku. Being there was rather like being transported back 
in time. I felt adrift in a hallowed place, one in which both the absence and presence of Bob were tangible and in perfect balance.

pendulum motionless<br>
yet the clock in the Friends hall<br>
