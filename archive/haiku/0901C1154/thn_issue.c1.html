&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I complete the baby quilt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begun for me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            Carolyn Hall</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Haiku poets and critics, ancient and modern, agree that one of  
haiku&#8217;s essential features is a sense of seasonality. When nature and  
her seasons are effectively linked to human experience great emotional depth 
is possible in a brief poetic expression. In some haiku, seasonality may be 
explicitly conveyed by a season word. In other instances, such as this 
issue&#8217;s Editors&#8217; Choice Award winner by Carolyn Hall, it may be 
implicit, a feeling or sensibility that dwells everywhere in the poem 
without specific mention anywhere.
</p>
<p>
The visual image in the first line creates a frame-within-a-frame,  
focusing our attention and drawing us intimately into the poem&#8217;s  
activity. The em-dash marking the end of line one functions like a 
<i>kireji</i>, the Japanese &#8220;cutting word,&#8221; giving emotional 
emphasis to the  image that precedes it, as well as providing its own 
frame that  separates the poem&#8217;s two juxtaposed images.
</p>
<p>
The circle and light and darkness are visual and spiritual images  
that resonate throughout the entire poem. In our species&#8217; infancy  
light  was fire, which also provided warmth and safety from dangers  
real and imagined. In our personal infancies such a sense of security  
and comfort was most likely afforded by a treasured family quilt or  
tattered old blanket. The passage from darkness to light marks the  
end of an old day and the start of a new one. The circular glow of  
the light suggests our planet&#8217;s path around its lamp, the sun, a  
journey responsible for the very seasons we celebrate in haiku. The  
circle is also a symbol of continuity, and the seasons that mark our  
ascendence, decline, and eventual demise flow seamlessly one into the  
next, year after year.
</p>
<p>
The theme of continuity is picked up in line two; the quilt begun for  
the poet before she was born is now being completed by her. Quilting,  
often a communal activity, is here carried out in solitude. The  
family and friends who first worked on it have possibly passed on,  
but they are present in the quilt that bears their love and  
craftsmanship and in the love and skill with which the poet, whom  
they probably taught to quilt, completes their work. Might the  
quilter be completing this now for a new relative, and might other  
babies she will never personally know one day be comforted by it as  
well?
</p>
<p>
For me, the season that resonates throughout the poem&#8217;s images and  
deepens its emotional significance is winter. Perhaps the most  
complex of haiku&#8217;s seasons, it seems the very edge between light and  
dark.  
The cold brevity of its days makes us take stock of the rapidity with  
which our time here is passing.  
It is the season of completion, of the cycle of the year, and of our  
lives. Though it is the time of the longest, coldest nights, it can  
also be a time of austere, even lush beauty.  
In the midst of this cold and darkness, the gradual lengthening of  
days hints that powerful forces of renewal are at work, for the point  
at which a circle is completed is the point at which it begins again.
