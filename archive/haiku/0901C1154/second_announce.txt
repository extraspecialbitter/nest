Dear Friends and Readers of The Heron's Nest,

A brief reminder that Thursday, the 15th of this month, is the  
deadline to submit work for us to consider for the June issue.

Also an update. Volume VIII is now in the hands of the printer, so  
the target release date of the first week in April is looking good.  
If you haven't yet purchased a copy and have been planning to, now  
would be a good time.

Wishing you happiness and inspiration, as always,

Christopher Herold
