Dear Friends, Readers, and contributors,

I have some announcements and a reminder for you.

First of all, the March issue of Volume IX is now available for your  
reading pleasure at <http://theheronsnest@cablespeed.com/>

Along with the March issue, we are delighted to present 
the results  of both the Readers’ Choice Awards voting: 
<http://www.theheronsnest.com/haiku/0901C1154/readers_choice_2006.html>

and the Second Annual Heron’s Nest Illustration Contest:
<http://www.theheronsnest.com/haiku/0901C1154/2006_illustration_contest.html>

Congratulations to you whose haiku were elected by your peers 
as their favorites from The Nests of 2006, and to you whose  
illustrations were selected for soon-to-be printed paper edition 
of Volume VIII. The results make winners of us all.

TO ORDER A PAPER EDITION OF THE HERON’S NEST, VOLUME VIII

Many of you  have already ordered copies of Volume VIII. That is much  
appreciated since it has helped me determine the number of copies to  
have printed. If you have not already ordered a copy, now would be a  
very good time to do so. The cost of Volume VIII is $16 in the US,  
$18 in Canada or Mexico, and $20 everywhere else. Make checks or  
postal money orders out to The Heron’s Nest  and send to Christopher  
Herold, 816 Taft Street, Port Townsend, WA 98368 USA.

A big thank you to all of you for helping to making The Heron’s Nest  
such an enjoyable experience!

Christopher Herold
Managing Editor
