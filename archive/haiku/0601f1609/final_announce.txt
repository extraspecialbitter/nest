Dear Heron's Nest Readers,

This is your final reminder that the voting deadline is nearly here,
only two days away. After midnight on Thursday, January 15, no more
ballots will be accepted. For voting guidelines, please go to the
following URL:

The competition has gotten very exciting so, if you haven't yet voted, 
I do hope that you will. The present order of leading poems and poets
could certainly change in the next couple of days if more votes arrive.

Wishing you all well, as always,

Christopher Herold
