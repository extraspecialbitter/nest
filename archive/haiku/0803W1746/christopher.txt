Subject: The September Nest

Dear Herons,

Here's the arrangement that, with the help of an unexpected breeze, I've put  together for September. Please go over it carefully and let me know of any mistakes I could easily have made. Especially check on the locations of your poets. I think I caught the ones who have changed addresses, but maybe not all of them. There are a few poets for whom I have no location as yet. I went through our Master List, previous Nest issues, and the HSA membership list without success. Here are the poets in question:

Spike:     	Charisma Ramchandani
Tako:		Jonny Colley
			Colin Stewart Jones
Tif:			Patricia Benedict

Thanks for checking these out for me.

Before giving you the arranged Nest, I'd like to address the following haiku.
In the process of organizing this issue, I see three poems that I think could be improved significantly. I find that coming to the poems during the arrangement process is quite different than studying them in the selection process. It's as if I'm now seeing the poems as having received editorial approval, as if they're already published and I'm reading them for the first time in some journal or other. Before now, during our selection process, I scrutinized them in a more raw sense. Don't know if this makes any sense to you. It's rather difficult to put into words. Anyway, I'd like you to reconsider these poems. If my suggestions sit well with you, then let's drop notes to the poets asking them for permission to make the changes. If a change is rejected, then of course, the original is still accepted. Here are the three:

her long skirt
trembles
and tulip leaf too
Lenard D. Moore

This one seems OH so awkward to me. If I read it in any other magazine I'd be shaking my head in a perplexed way. Can't figure why we accepted it, but we did. The second line, comprised of a single verb, seems very weak. I see little leeway in getting around that. But it's the third line that really bugs me. Major Tontoism. I think that can be fixed, at any rate, so this is what I suggest:

her long skirt
trembles--                                    (or "trembling--")
the tulip leaf too
Lenard D. Moore

* * *

no rain for days--
a half-eaten apple taken away
from the fruit flies
Gary Hotham

The second line is awfully long, syllabically and rhythmically. Couldn't we just delete "away?" 

no rain for days--
a half-eaten apple taken
from the fruit flies
Gary Hotham

or better yet, perhaps:

no rain for days--
a half-eaten apple
taken from the fruit flies
Gary Hotham

* * *

distant virga
the ranch dog's eyes
two different colors
Allan Burns

"Two" seems unnecessary and redundant. If the dog's eyes are different colors there couldn't be more than two colors (unless the dog is a mutant with three or more eyes). The poem would be more succinct:

distant virga
the ranch dog's eyes
different colors
Allan Burns

* * *

I suggest that we take a majority vote on this. For any changes that get the overall nod, we could then query the poets.

Thanks for your help with this. And now, here's the September issue. I hope you enjoy the flow of it.

Your friend, as always,

Christopher

Commentary

A Little Inn
 
Of the countless excellent haiku that appear in journals and contests, the best evoke emotion or sense of mood and offer unexpected insight.  Indeed, these qualities largely define haiku.  As one who reads these brief poems daily while wearing an editor's cap, I am often reminded that while the poet's hand is invisible in an outstanding work, the crafting of a successful haiku requires skill and percipience.  Each word must be carefully considered, no element of the finished haiku is random.  In order for a haiku to gain special notice from this journal's editors, its disparate images in juxtaposition must create a satisfying resonance.  A haiku often possesses other positive qualities, bonus qualities if you will, that engage our attention.  The September issue's Editors' Choice Award winner is that kind of haiku:               
 
a little inn
with a swinging sign-board . . .
the evening chill

                                          Michael McClintock
 
By alluding to a well-known person or literary work, one that is meaningful to the reader, a poem may create resonance beyond the significance of the immediate imagery.  Yet another layer of appeal surfaces when a haiku evokes the memory of an event similar to that in the haiku.  Michael McClintock's poem does both for this reader.  Its ambience and musicality initially draw me into the moment, and I am immediately reminded of the small inns in Europe where I sometimes stopped many years ago.  
 
The Japanese masters often paid homage to widely-known authors or their works.  The author of "a little inn" is in good, even revered company.  McClintock's timeless haiku could have been as true a century or more past as it is today.  Shiki or Santoka might have stayed at such an inn as this one, and like Basho, Issa, and other famous haijins, they wrote of the inns they visited during their travels.  In one of his most popular haiku, Basho depicts tiredly searching for an inn and finding wisteria in bloom.      
 
The repetition of short "i" sounds in "a little inn" creates a pleasant assonance, enhancing a mood that invites me to enter McClintock's poem and linger awhile.  I easily imagine coming upon this inn, its sign-board softly creaking as it rocks in the twilight wind. I am journeying alone, and the promise of human contact draws me closer. Already feeling the evening chill, I walk to the door. The fire that is surely crackling in the hearth will warm me.  Soon, with a hot toddy comforting my insides as well, I know that here is where I will spend the night.
