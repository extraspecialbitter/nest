Dear Friends, Readers, and Heron's Nest contributors,

The September issue of The Heron's Nest is now available for your reading 
pleasure at <http://www.theheronsnest.com/>.  As always, earlier issues 
are accessible as well; from the home page simply click on "Volume Contents" 
to read any of the thousands of haiku that have graced our pages over 
the past seven years plus.

Some deadline reminders: 

Submissions for the December issue of Volume VIII are due by September 15

pre-publication orders for Volume VIII. The costs are as follows:

Volume VII:  in the U.S.A. $15; in Canada or Mexico $16; elsewhere $17
Volume VII:  in the U.S.A. $16; in Canada or Mexico $18; elsewhere $20
