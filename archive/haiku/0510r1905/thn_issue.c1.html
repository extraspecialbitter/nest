Connie Donleycott </p>
<p>Haiku poets open themselves to the significant flashes of insight      
available through direct realization of everyday experiences. A sound, 
smell, or taste can awaken them to the profound suchness of a moment in
time. Disparate images converge to convey resonant intuitions that link
nature and human spirit. Haiku becomes a way of life, and the poet who 
lives in quiet harmony with that way trusts the sparest presentation of
essential details to engage the sensory involvement of readers and make
them participants and co-creators.                                     </p>
<p>Connie Donleycott&#8217;s &#8220;summer garden&#8221; is a splendid case in point. She       
names the season and setting, knowing readers will supply tomatoes,        
cucumbers, peas and beans, sunflowers, dahlias, marigolds, onions, and     
melons&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;whatever colorful images of lush abundance the context brings to
mind. Each reader can easily stand in the garden he or she imagines,       
ready to become part of the poem.                                          </p>
<p>This time it is a kinesthetic response that provides the tug into haiku 
awareness.  The garden hose reaches its limit and signals resistance    
with a backward pull. Gardener, poet, and reader register &#8220;the full     
stretch&#8221; and instinctively appreciate the expansiveness of summer's     
bounty just as they recognize its demands. They sense the unstated      
likeness of the summer garden to full adulthood, that season of greatest
human productivity and of challenges that test and stretch individual   
capacity. Perhaps the instant of heightened understanding includes      
consciousness, too, of states of being that require the full measure of 
human energy, physical, spiritual, and emotional. Because the poem is   
lean, simple, and imbued with karumi (lightness), we are left with a    
smile and a comfortable sense of adequacy. Just beyond the margins,     
though, lies recognition that when plenty becomes excess the equation   
shifts. Strain replaces tautness, and enough is suddenly too much. The  
pull of the hose is a gentle reality check.                             </p>
<p>The poet knows about heat and effort.  She appreciates the rewards of    
planning and nurturing. At an instant&#8217;s signal from a hollow rubber      
tube, she recognizes limitations as well.  We can imagine, if we want    
to, just how far an adjustment of the nozzle might extend the reach of   
life-giving water or what other methods a gardener might use to care for 
plants that have grown beyond ordinary reach. Haiku, after all, are      
open-ended and allow the reader to move back and forth in time on the    
pivot of the present moment. Past and future merge.  So do small and     
large, local and universal. A sensation that quivers briefly through the 
body informs the mind and spirit.                                        </p>
<p>Connie Donleycott writes clearly and honestly about real things in the  
real world, especially the ordinary activities of daily life. With      
characteristic freshness, she shares this moment of heightened awareness
in her summer garden so effectively that her readers are blessed with a 
richer understanding of their world and themselves.                     </p>
