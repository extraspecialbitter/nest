Hiya B3!

Everything going smoothly in your part of the world? Hope so.
We've been having some gorgeous weather out here. Too dry
but man! Clear skies and temps. in the 70s and 80s. I only
wish I could get out into it more. Yeah, I know, "bitch, bitch
bitch." Sigh . . .

And no, I really can't complain. We have, after all, a great
new issue of The Nest to put up. It's all done but for the
last phase of proofing. And . . . here it is, in plenty of time.
The Nest is officially in your court now.

Yer very own,

Punchy

COMMENTARY

 Late one afternoon, it was my job to stand well back and call out
guidance to my husband as he pruned a tall ligustrum. He wanted to give
it a rounded shape, to match its mate on the other side of the front
porch. Even before he silenced the trimmer's motor and asked me to come
"steady" him as he climbed even higher, I was thinking of Robert
Gilliland's lovely haiku:

    late wisteria
    the stepladder
    wobbles

At first, this seems an unlikely coupling of images. What in the world
does "late wisteria" have to do with a stepladder, and one that wobbles,
at that? Nothing^×and everything! I imagine the poet outside. Perhaps he
is cleaning windows or painting a wall or repairing a hole made by a
woodpecker along the eaves. Perhaps a bit of pruning or adjusting a
downspout. My knowing exactly what job he's doing is not important to
the levels of meaning below the surface of the poem.

While the poet is intent on his chore, a familiar scent comes to him now
and then on a breeze. Finally he pauses and acknowledges the source.
Ahh, the wisteria, still in bloom. Then, just as he takes another breath
of sweet fragrance, the ladder wobbles. I can^Òt help but perceive
Gilliland^Òs poem as a metaphor for the ups and downs of our lives. So
many times, when we are contentedly taking care of business, or just as
we are thinking what a pleasant time we^Òre having, the unexpected
catches us off guard. The day wobbles. Isn^Òt that the way of it?
Sometimes we come crashing down, but usually we find our balance and
keep going.

There are several varieties of wisteria, a genus in the pea family. The
aroma of its showy purplish or white racemes may be intoxicatingly heavy
or tantalizingly faint. But it might be best known for its climbing
woody vines that can grow as thick as tree trunks. The main trunk is
actually a combination of twisted and coiled stems. Wisteria can tear
down balcony banisters and damage roofs and gutters. If allowed to grow
unchecked for many years, the huge stems can lift a house right off its
foundation. When I was a child, an ancient oak that supported a huge
wisteria was "Tarzan's jungle" for my friends and me. We used to climb
the large, twisted stems like monkeys. Some of the smaller ones that
hung down from the oak branches had grown into stiff crooks and circles
and loops. We used them like the hanging bars on a swing set.

For one who knows wisteria, this poem is sure to bring out a sense of
contrast between the strength of the plant and the wobbliness of the
ladder or person. Similarities between wisteria and ladders and between
the plant and people also come to mind. The flowers tremble or "wobble"
even when there^Òs no wind. In its growing season, the new tendrils reach
out, grasping anything in their path. The heady beauty and perfume of
wisteria can make people feel wobbly and, of course, a person on a
ladder that begins to wobble will reach out to grip something firm.

The opening words "late wisteria" are pleasant and inviting.  Following
the clear caesura, the poet creates a little tension by leaving "the
stepladder" alone on the second line. As I see it, the final telling
word, "wobbles," does not end the poem, but rather leaves readers with
several intriguing possibilities. At this point, we can let our own
experiences show us what might happen next, or we may simply enjoy the
small drama^Òs bit of mystery.

This haiku is rich with implied color and scent. For me the appeal of
"late wisteria" is not so much in what it says, as in what it does not
say. The author concisely sets up the scene for readers. He shows only
enough to draw us into his moment so that we can make it our own. I am
delighted that memory and imagination allow me to participate in Robert
Gilliand^Òs elegantly rendered haiku.
