            <p>Late one afternoon, it was my job to stand well back and call out 
              guidance to my husband as he pruned a tall ligustrum. He wanted 
              to give it a rounded shape, to match its mate on the other side 
              of the front porch. Even before he silenced the trimmer&#8217;s 
              motor and asked me to come &#8220;steady&#8221; him as he climbed 
              even higher, I was thinking of Robert Gilliland&#8217;s lovely haiku:</p>
            <p>late wisteria<br>
              the stepladder<br>
              wobbles</p>
            <p>At first, this seems an unlikely coupling of images. What in the 
              world does &#8220;late wisteria&#8221; have to do with a stepladder, 
              and one that wobbles, at that? Nothing-and everything! I imagine 
              the poet outside. Perhaps he is cleaning windows or painting a wall 
              or repairing a hole made by a woodpecker along the eaves. Perhaps 
              a bit of pruning or adjusting a downspout. My knowing exactly what 
              job he&#8217;s doing is not important to the levels of meaning below 
              the surface of the poem.</p>
            <p>While the poet is intent on his chore, a familiar scent comes to 
              him now and then on a breeze. Finally he pauses and acknowledges 
              the source. Ahh, the wisteria, still in bloom. Then, just as he 
              takes another breath of sweet fragrance, the ladder wobbles. I can&#8217;t 
              help but perceive Gilliland&#8217;s poem as a metaphor for the ups 
              and downs of our lives. So many times, when we are contentedly taking 
              care of business, or just as we are thinking what a pleasant time 
              we're having, the unexpected catches us off guard. The day wobbles. 
              Isn't that the way of it? Sometimes we come crashing down, but usually 
              we find our balance and keep going. </p>
            <p>There are several varieties of wisteria, a genus in the pea family. 
              The aroma of its showy purplish or white racemes may be intoxicatingly 
              heavy or tantalizingly faint. But it might be best known for its 
              climbing woody vines that can grow as thick as tree trunks. The 
              main trunk is actually a combination of twisted and coiled stems. 
              Wisteria can tear down balcony banisters and damage roofs and gutters. 
              If allowed to grow unchecked for many years, the huge stems can 
              lift a house right off its foundation. When I was a child, an ancient 
              oak that supported a huge wisteria was &#8220;Tarzan&#8217;s jungle&#8221; 
              for my friends and me. We used to climb the large, twisted stems 
              like monkeys. Some of the smaller ones that hung down from the oak 
              branches had grown into stiff crooks and circles and loops. We used 
              them like the hanging bars on a swing set. </p>
            <p>For one who knows wisteria, this poem is sure to bring out a sense 
              of contrast between the strength of the plant and the wobbliness 
              of the ladder or person. Similarities between wisteria and ladders 
              and between the plant and people also come to mind. The flowers 
              tremble or &#8220;wobble&#8221; even when there&#8217;s no wind. 
              In its growing season, the new tendrils reach out, grasping anything 
              in their path. The heady beauty and perfume of wisteria can make 
              people feel wobbly and, of course, a person on a ladder that begins 
              to wobble will reach out to grip something firm.</p>
            <p>The opening words &#8220;late wisteria&#8221; are pleasant and 
              inviting. Following the clear caesura, the poet creates a little 
              tension by leaving &#8220;the stepladder&#8221; alone on the second 
              line. As I see it, the final telling word, &#8220;wobbles,&#8221;does 
              not end the poem, but rather leaves readers with several intriguing 
              possibilities. At this point, we can let our own experiences show 
              us what might happen next, or we may simply enjoy the small drama&#8217;s 
              bit of mystery.</p>
            <p>This haiku is rich with implied color and scent. For me the appeal 
              of &#8220;late wisteria&#8221; is not so much in what it says, as 
              in what it does not say. The author concisely sets up the scene 
              for readers. He shows only enough to draw us into his moment so 
              that we can make it our own. I am delighted that memory and imagination 
              allow me to participate in Robert Gilliand&#8217;s elegantly rendered 
              haiku. </p>
