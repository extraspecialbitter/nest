	Connie Donleycott has a way with words. Her haiku, while instantly      
understood by the reader, nonetheless illuminate their subjects in fresh
and often pleasantly surprising ways:                                   
<br><br>                                                                     
finding a way  <br>                                                         
through the forest    <br>                                                  
winter sunlight                                                         
  <br><br>                                                                      
The first two lines of this haiku might suggest a lost hiker or an      
adventurer. The final line completes the poem in an unexpected way,     
revealing that it is the sunlight&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;and not a person&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;that has navigated 
the forest. The result is not just a description from nature but rather 
the celebration of a completed journey.                                 
<br><br>                                                                        
Connie frequently begins with a scene from nature. Then, like a camera, 
her words focus in on an object with a human connection, allowing the   
reader to share her discovery.   
<br><br>

<br><br>

Sometimes nature encounters humanity directly, often with delightful 
results:  
<br><br>

grains of sand fill <br>                                                 
her smile lines                                                      
<br><br>                                                                  
As I revisit Connie&#8217;s haiku from Volume V, my smile lines deepen as 
well.

	<p></p> 
	        <p>vincent tripi breathes new life into the haiku genre. He often does this 
by presenting common subjects from uncommon perspectives. Sometimes this is startling:                                                                
              <br>
              <br>
              her only nipple <br>
              begins to harden <br>
              a new year <br>
              <br>
              Deathbed . . .<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my old friend&#8217;s imitation<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of 
              a firefly <br>
              <br>
              The connections between people, or between people and nature, are 
              often central to tripi&#8217;s haiku. He is a master of &#8220;show 
              don&#8217;t tell,&#8221; ever nudging us toward a deeper, more universal 
              understanding of the experience described. A good example is &#8220;small 
              town&nbsp;&#8212; / the smell of / everyone&#8217;s wood.&#8221; 
              On the surface, the olfactory image is plain enough, and easily 
              accessible. Without digging far, however, one uncovers an intriguing 
              paradox: we are at once independent and interdependent. With a casual 
              sniff, the scent of woodsmoke may seem homogeneous, but tripi is 
              sensitive, a haiku poet. He detects at least one particular variety 
              of wood and intuits a multitude of fires. The smoke from each rises 
              and mingles with smoke from the others. One more step returns him 
              to the recognition of a unified whole. The small size of the town 
              is meaningful here. Most of the inhabitants know and interact with 
              one another, just as the various odors of smoke rise and mingle. 
              tripi&#8217;s haiku are not without humor. In this poem he pokes 
              fun, subtly, at another side of the same fact: in small towns everyone 
              knows what everyone else is doing. Sometimes his humor is right 
              up front, as in one of my favorites:
			  <br><br>
			  a foot of snow&nbsp;&#8212;<br>                                                          
the cat out loving and <br>                                                   
where is the garden Buddha?                                               
 <br><br>                                                                         
Superficially, this is hilarious&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;the thought of a cat&#8217;s kinky romancing 
of a stone Buddha. Even so, as with most of tripi&#8217;s work, there are      
profound levels. The garden Buddha (just a representation of the          
historical figure) is transcended, literally and figuratively, by snow.   
A great leveler of playing fields, the snow covers everything, leading    
us to realize that there is &#8220;nowhere to spit and not hit Buddha!&#8221;       
 <br><br>                                                                         
vince tripi&#8217;s work is exciting, provocative, and rewarding. I&#8217;m         
delighted that readers have voted accordingly.                            
 <br><br>

	<p></p> 
	Allen McGill lives in Mexico. <em>The Heron&#8217;s Nest</em> first published his work
in December 2002, and he has contributed regularly to our journal ever  
since. It has been my great pleasure to serve as his editor.            
 <br><br>                                                                       
This year Allen&#8217;s fellow readers and writers awarded him the fourth    
highest number of votes overall. He won <em>The Heron&#8217;s Nest</em> Award in July 
2003, with a poem whose beauty and level of insight continue to garner 
praise from readers. Of his ten poems that appeared in Volume V, &#8220;storm
clouds&#8221; received the most points:                                      
 <br><br>                                                                       
storm clouds  <br>

farm by farm            
<br><br>
Allen&#8217;s haiku demonstrate his respect for the natural world and his   
affinity for its creatures. Many feature animals, usually combined with
some aspect of humanity. Skillfully balancing humankind and nature,    
Allen juxtaposes vivid images to create memorable, multilayered haiku. 
His work is rich with sensory appeal that draws readers into the       
experience.                                                  
<br><br>                                                                       
a gull slips   <br>

<br><br>

<br><br>
 Allen&#8217;s haiku come from the real world, from life. When he includes  
himself, he is careful not to get in the way of the poem.
