Connie Donleycott has a way with words.  Her haiku, while instantly understood 
by the reader, nonetheless illuminate their subjects in fresh and often 
pleasantly surprising ways:

finding a way 
through the forest 
winter sunlight 

The first two lines of this haiku might suggest a lost hiker or an adventurer.
The final line completes the poem in an unexpected way, revealing that it 
is the sunlight - and not a person - that has navigated the forest.  The 
result is not just a description from nature but rather the celebration of 
a completed journey.

Connie frequently begins her haiku with an image from nature.  Then, like a
camera, her words focus in on an object with a human connection, allowing
the reader to share in her discovery.

blowing rain . . .
colors blend
on a garden pinwheel

winter windstorm 
a tea kettle whistles 
on the woodstove

summer garden 
the full stretch
of the hose

Sometimes nature encounters humanity directly, often with delightful results:

beachcomber
grains of sand fill
her smile lines

As I revisit Connie's haiku from Volume V, my smile lines deepen as well.
