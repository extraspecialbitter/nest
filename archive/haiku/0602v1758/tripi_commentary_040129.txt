Deathbed . . .
my old friend's imitation
of a firefly

vincent tripi

The effectiveness of this wonderful haiku begins with the starkness and 
immediacy of the raw emotion it evokes - the imminent death of an old friend.  
vincent tripi's use of the single word "deathbed" demands the reader's 
attention and reflection, capturing the most basic human frailty and leaving 
us to contemplate all of its implications.

We are not left in this state for long, however.  The haiku strengthens and 
deepens by providing a simple but vivid reminder of the brevity of life.
This reminder comes in the form of a firefly, whose care-free floating 
through summer breezes belies its short lifespan.  How very much like our 
own experience this is - a balmy night of flutter and flash, seemingly 
timeless, but over much too soon.

It is this very analogy that completes the haiku, the realization that our 
own existence, so full of cares and worries, is nonetheless fleeting, and in 
that sense isnot at all unlike that of a firefly.

vincent tripi's use of the word "imitation" is intriguing in that the dying 
friend is most likely not trying to consciously mimic a firefly.  Instead, 
this imitation occurred in the mind of the author, who, in gazing at his 
friend, drifted back to a moment long ago, a seemingly endless summer night.  
Like the flashing of a firefly, however, this moment, too is short-lived, 
leaving only the resonating words of this sad and lovely haiku.
