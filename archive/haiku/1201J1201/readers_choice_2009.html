<p>
The Editors and Web Master of <i>The Heron&#8217;s Nest</i> are pleased to announce the results of the Readers&#8217; Choice Awards 
for favorite poems and poets featured in Volume XI, 2009.
</p>
<p>
A record 123 voters provided us with their top ten poems from Volume XI. We are very grateful indeed that so many 
readers took the time to revisit the 492 eligible poems we published last year (in addition to memorial poems for Paul O. Williams 
and D. Claire Gallagher) and made their top selections known to us.
</p>
<p>
The print edition of Volume XI, to be mailed in April, will include the contents of all four quarterly issues, the entire awards 
report, with commentary, a section of special mention poems, and a generous sample of comments by readers on individual poems and 
on the voting process, plus winning entries from the illustration contest. For information on how to order, please visit 
<a href="http://www.haikupoet.com/nest/journal/">http://www.haikupoet.com/nest/journal/</a>.

        POPULAR POETS<br>
        <br>
<p>
This category represents the total number of points awarded each poet for their entire body of work in Volume XI. The most poems an 
individual can have accepted in The Nest each year is eight. Obviously, the more poems a person publishes, the greater chances he or 
she has of attracting votes. Two poets had eight poems published during 2009 and two poets had seven. While this is always a factor 
in the final results, perhaps it was somewhat less so this year, as witnessed by the fact that the two poets topping the list have 
very clear voting margins and some other top voted poets achieved that result with many fewer poems.
</p>
<p>
To put into perspective how well the winners did: the average total points for combined works this year was 29.
