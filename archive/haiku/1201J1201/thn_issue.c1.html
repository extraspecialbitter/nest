&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fishing village<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a rumor of blues running<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through the caf&eacute;<br></font></font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Jim Kacian</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
In the close-knit economy of a fishing village, news of bluefish running would generate a welcome rush of activity.  Blues are 
important commercially and for sport. They migrate in sizable schools following baitfish and are likely to cause a stir wherever 
they show up along the world&#8217;s coastlines. Their appearance brings the promise of good fishing for those who know how to 
outfight them, good eating for those who enjoy bold flavor, and prosperity for knowledgeable fishermen and the businesses that 
support them.
</p>
<p>
Through its rhythm and diction Jim Kacian&#8217;s haiku communicates the electricity such news would set loose, while poetically 
suggesting significant undercurrents. The rumor of blues running is one village folk would want to confirm quickly. As readers we 
are momentarily surprised by the third line. We were ready to hear the run located north of the pier, or along the coast in the 
next county, or a mile or so out to sea. As we pause to accept the perfectly credible information that the rumor is running 
&#8220;through the caf&eacute;,&#8221; we recognize &#8220;running&#8221; as a word that does double duty, referring simultaneously 
to the fish and the unverified report of their appearance. The poet has skillfully merged the characteristics of rumor and the nature 
of bluefish, and, by extension, he draws our thoughts to ways schools of fish and groups of human beings are alike and different. 
</p>
<p>
Suddenly shadow poems swirl below the surface. The &#8220;blues&#8221; of depression, personal and economic, might spread through a 
fishing community as readily as good news. Rumors can convey beneficial information or falsehoods as sharp-toothed and vicious as 
the bluefish that may or may not be running nearby at the moment of the poem. And the haiku&#8217;s musicality invites consideration 
of blues music, celebrating sadness and often based on the inhumane treatment of human beings by other human beings. Bluefish, after 
all, are ravenous predators and even cannibals. 
</p>
<p>
Such shadows emphasize the positive energy buzzing through the caf&eacute;. Vitality, conviviality, and interdependence are all the 
more striking against the contrast of their opposites. For readers, &#8220;a rumor of blues&#8221; becomes a phrase to remember and 
run with.
