COMMENTARY

July second, 1826, in a custom-made bed (extra long), in an alcove
between office and bedchamber, in a house he designed, the third
President of The United States fell into a coma. Very ill for five days
from an intestinal malady, probably cancer, Thomas Jefferson was
attended by his physician, daughter, family, and friends. The house
slaves listened from adjoining rooms and from the basement through the
dumbwaiter. For the next two days, Jefferson regained consciousness
several times and clearly asked what was the date. Told it was the
second of the month, then the third, he fell back insensate each time.
When his question was answered that it was the fourth of July, he
sighed, and was dead at age eighty-three. He lived until the fiftieth
anniversary of the formal signing of The Declaration of Independence he
had authored.

vincent tripi^Òs haiku brought to mind this story still told by the
docents at Monticello in Virginia. More personally, I was also
transported to memories of several deathbeds of my own loved ones.

The one-word setting, "deathbed," is an extremely powerful beginning for
this poem. It evokes images  surrounded by ritual. The solemnity and
import of the process of dying is quite universal across cultures. With
the first line set apart from the rest by an ellipsis, a reader pauses
to ponder the natures of death and living. Using a second concise image,
tripi tells of friendship. The relationship between the two people, one
dying, one surviving, has been a long one and a reader may infer that
neither principal is young. The poet himself is indeed central to the
poem. He shares this experiencing of death with his friend. The poem^Òs
third part is the concept of "firefly." In the dark, a firefly is bright
then gone again, flying on in blackness. Its reappearance is a flash in
a different place. Haiku as a genre can contain such a figurative image.
tripi employs it so lightly that its resonance brings me back to the
intensity of the opening image. Rather than just mentioning the insect
for the setting, perhaps as a line unto itself, he shows the metaphor
directly. The technique is masterful, much more subtle and effective.
The poet states that what he sees is an imitation. The haiku succeeds
because of this gentleness of touch; it avoids an obviousness that would
ruin the sharing of deep emotions.

How powerful is this simple evocation of experience so basic to humans.
Light and dark . . . consciousness here and gone . . . life and death.
How rich was this friendship, this love.
