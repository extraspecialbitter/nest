	  The editors of <em>The Heron&#8217;s Nest</em> join the family, friends, and world-wide admirers of Elizabeth 
	  Searle Lamb in grateful celebration of her remarkable life. Her immeasurable contributions to the 
	  development of American haiku weave threads of kindness, compassion, intelligence, depth, 
	  experimentation, enthusiasm, and twinkling humor into its fabric and spirit. She leaves a body of 
	  poems so rich and timeless that when I am sad there will be no new ones in my mailbox, I imagine 
	  Elizabeth suggesting, &#8220;You could read some old ones again,&#8221; and then adding a little 
	  smiley face to her note. I believe she would be pleased that so many of us have re-read and shared 
	  her haiku since her death. Surely, she would welcome the words of comfort and fellow feeling that 
	  have passed among us and the thoughtful way her closest friends have assured us that her passing 
	  was gentle. Elizabeth&#8217;s message was always one of love and peace, and her wish for us remains 
	  clear and simple: &#8220;May haiku bring you joy.&#8221;

	  Thinking of Elizabeth 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  From first meeting Elizabeth and Bruce years ago in Manhattan, through times shared with them in 
	  Santa Fe until Bruce&#8217;s death in 1992, and with Elizabeth since then, she has been one of my 
	  dearest friends. Her vibrant optimism and caring friendship, her indomitable spirit (always seeing 
	  things &#8220;in the light&#8221;), and her gentle humor nourished my days. She was a superb haiku 
	  poet with a lively intellect and finely tuned creative voice, and we often shared both haiku and 
	  longer poems. How beautifully she opened her heart to so many of us. She was a source of spiritual 
	  strength! 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  We shared both fine and challenging times, many a good meal, well loved novels, lots of poems, and 
	  a running joke about how easily I fell asleep on her couch. We both loved to watch ice-skating, 
	  and even from New Jersey, I&#8217;d still call her to say, &#8220;Turn on ABC; Michele Kwan is 
	  skating.&#8221; And then we&#8217;d watch together across the miles. Elizabeth was and continues 
	  to be such a strong presence in my life that, although I already miss her sorely, I feel she&#8217;s 
	  still here, looking over my shoulder as I write this, and saying, in her usual fashion, 
	  &#8220;Oh my!&#8221;
	  </p>

	   I have posted one of Elizabeth&#8217;s haiku on a dictionary stand here in the lobby of Cornell 
	   University&#8217;s A. R. Mann Library:
	  </p>
<blockquote>the broken harp string<br>
curving<br>
into sunlight
<br><br>
&#8212;&nbsp;Elizabeth Searle Lamb</blockquote>
<p>
and in looking at her many wonderful haiku in <em>Across the Windharp</em>, I am very moved at the indelible 
graciousness, specialness, and extraordinary life she lived. I&#8217;ll never forget all her encouraging 
feedback from the days she was editor at <em>Frogpond</em>. She always had kind words, and gentle yet clear 
guidance to offer, and she made me feel very accepted as a novice writer way back then. It is hard to 
imagine her not &#8220;here&#8221; but hopefully she is in peace, and
love, and certainly we will all celebrate her magnificent life and her   
many gifts to us. To share the sorrow of her passing and the joy in      
knowing such a remarkable and beautiful being:

I regret not knowing Elizabeth personally, but I have always admired her work. My favorite poem of hers is: 
</p>
<blockquote>
by the night light<br>
tiny spider&#8217;s tiny web<br>
leaving it there
<br><br>
&#8212;&nbsp;Elizabeth Searle Lamb 
</blockquote>
<p>
Over these last years I have always thought of her that way, as that tiny spider&#8212;our night light if 
you will&#8212;at the edge of the community, at the edge of her beloved desert, her poetic web spun years 
ago. She helped make it possible for later poets like myself to find a receptive audience.
</p>
<blockquote>
the tiny web remains&nbsp;&#8212;<br>
to I don’t know where<br>
this arroyo wind
<br><br>
&#8212;&nbsp;paul m. 
</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="POEM5"></a>
I was very sorry to hear about dear Elizabeth&#8217;s passing . . . a very gentle, kind soul, a true haiku 
spirit. I corresponded with her often and she was always very encouraging. She was a haiku mentor for me. 
</p>

A letter and collective gift to Elizabeth sent by John Stevenson, March 31, 1998: 
</p>
<p>
Dear Elizabeth,
</p>
<p>
The enclosed is returned to you, with love. I am told that this began as your Christmas greeting to 
Arizona Zipper. From there, it has passed through the hands of a series of haiku friends, wintering with 
Bruce Ross, Tom Clausen, Carol Conti-Entin, Fay Aoyagi, Ebba Story, and me. Now it is spring and we 
return your greeting, sevenfold.
</p>
<p>
(Elizabeth&#8217;s poem to Zipper was) 
</p>
<blockquote>
early blizzard<br>
the faintest cries of wild geese<br>
in the dark, in the snow
<br><br>
&#8212;&nbsp;Elizabeth Searle Lamb 
</blockquote>
<p>
(And the following poems were added, in this order) 
</p>
<a name="POEM6"></a>
<blockquote>
snowflakes<br>
astrologer<br>
stargazing       
<br><br>
&#8212;&nbsp;Arizona Zipper 
</blockquote>

&#8212;&nbsp;Carol Conti-Entin 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<a name="POEM11"></a>
<blockquote>

<br><br>

<blockquote>

<br><br>

<p>
I always thought this was an example of how Elizabeth&#8217;s generous spirit inspired something of the 
kind in others.

On Elizabeth&#8217;s Going 
</p>
<p>
Carolyn Lamb, Elizabeth&#8217;s daughter, has lived for some time in a house just across a shared driveway 
from her mother. She was with her mother much of the time through the two recent short hospitalizations, 
and told us that when Elizabeth was last in the hospital, her regular M.D. stopped in to see her, and she 
told him she was ready to go. She said to him, &#8220;When I get there, I&#8217;ll write you a letter and 
let you know how it is.&#8221; Wry humor and light inextricably mixed in much of what Elizabeth said and 
wrote. 
</p>
<p>
After that hospitalization, Elizabeth went home to hospice care, which she and Carolyn had agreed was the 
best for her situation. On Elizabeth&#8217;s last afternoon, Carolyn was with her mother, and shared the 
fact that one of her poems that appeared in <em>The Heron&#8217;s Nest</em> in 2004 was singled out for special 
mention in the annual Valentine&#8217;s Day awards. The poem goes: 
</p>
<blockquote>
still wanting<br>
to fly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these feathers<br>
of the dead owl
<br><br>
&#8212;&nbsp;Elizabeth Searle Lamb 
</blockquote>
<p>
A few tears ran down Elizabeth&#8217;s cheek when when Carolyn read the poem. Carolyn went on to read some 
of her mother&#8217;s poems from <em>Across the Windharp</em> to her. And so it was when Elizabeth stopped 
breathing, with Carolyn and a caregiver on either side of her, and she at peace. 
</p>
<blockquote>
a spring flurry<br>
crows large as ravens<br>
move tree to tree
<br><br>
