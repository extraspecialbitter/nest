Dear Friends, Readers, and Contributors,

I have two reminders for you. 

First, there are four more days for you to submit work to be considered for 
the June issue. The deadline is midnight, Tuesday, March 15. If you have not 
yet sent us some of your haiku, we hope that you will.

Second, the first annual edition of The Heron's Nest  (Volume VII, 2005, due 
out in March of 2006) can be pre-ordered. A big thank you to those who have 
already ordered copies. We are very grateful for your swift and enthusiastic 
show of support! 

With my best wishes,

Christopher Herold
Managing Editor
