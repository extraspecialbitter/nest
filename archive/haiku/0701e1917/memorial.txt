pausing
halfway through a life
with chrysanthemums
Jim Kacian 

warm hand held tightly
     dream of a maple seedling
     ready for planting

Afternoon of a Faun
snow sparkles
in the arroyo
Raffael de Gruttola

her last breath . . .
the strings vibrating
on her dusty harp
Michael Dylan Welch

The old wind chimes
in the basement for winter
tinkle from my sigh
George Swede

news of her death—
winter moon descending
beyond the trees
Paul David Mena

tree-filtered moon
the night wind
in a leafpile
Paul MacNeil

she is gone . . .
the soft call
of a mourning dove
Naomi Y. Brown

gone then?
cherry petals fall away
in the rain
Paul O. Williams

raining--
I discuss tomorrow
with falling petals
Fay Aoyagi

her gentle passing . . .
a robin flock settles
on the front porch
Ferris Gilli

no night clouds—
just the numbing news
of her crossing over
Lenard D. Moore

this is how life is—
hearing the cricket at dawn
just as it ceases
Michael McClintock

quiet arroyo
the song borne somewhere else
by wind
Christopher Herold

if someone should ask
tell them she loved
ginger snaps and tea
Marian Olson

moonless
the rain-muffled cries
of returning geese
Robert Gilliland

a ripple
reaches the pond's edge—
daffodils
Peggy Willis Lyles

I pause
halfway up the stair . . .
because she has paused
George Dorsty
