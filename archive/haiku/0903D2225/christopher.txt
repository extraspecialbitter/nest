Dear Braised Bird,
I have all but three poet locations for the September issue so I
think I'll just send you what I have
and send the three locations when they come to me. I just want to be
sure you have plenty of time
to do your usual magic.

Wishing you all good things, as always,

punchy the thwackster

Heron~Rs Nest Award

buffalo bones
a wind less than a whisper
in the summer grass
Chad Lee Robinson

COMMENTARY

Now this is a deceptively quiet haiku. Entering it, my breathing
slows and then, with little more than a whisper, Chad Lee Robinson
ferries me back in time to two far-flung locales, North America~Rs
Great Plains and the small town of Hiraizumi in the province of Iwate
in Japan. In these places, I overlook three diverse cultures:
European, Native American, and Japanese, and I become witness to two
horrific events: the massacre of buffalo in the United States during
the 1870s and ~Q80s, and the historic battle of Ichi-no-Tani in
Japan, which occurred on March 18, 1184. The key to envisioning these
events is yet another alluded-to moment that took place in the year
1689, when Matsuo Basho penned a haiku that was destined to become
one of his classics. All of these times, events, places, and cultures
can be discovered in this one exquisite haiku of just twelve words. 

The opening line, ~Sbuffalo bones,~T places me on a midwestern
prairie. I am struck by the tranquility of this expansive landscape,
and I imagine the vast herds that once peacefully grazed there. But
then, as I stand above the weathered bones of a buffalo, half-hidden
among the tall summer grasses, my imagination conjures a railroad
stretching east and west as far as the eye can see. A train enters my
restful reverie. It is packed with U. S. soldiers and pioneers,
mostly of European ancestry. All at once, I see rifles thrust from
open windows and puffs of smoke issuing from the long barrels. I hear
the screams of the terrified bison and the thunder of their hooves as
they stampede away from the train. The scene brings tears to my eyes.

The wholesale slaughter of buffalo was a plan conceived by American
colonists whose intent was to deprive First Nation Peoples of their
primary source of food. The resultant butchery later came to be known
as the Great Buffalo Massacre. It was so successful that by 1889 an
estimated population of some 75 million was reduced to a mere 540.
The prairies were veritably littered with their bones.

While ~Sbuffalo bones~T is the primary means of alluding to the Great
Buffalo Massacre, it is through the words of Robinson~Rs second
allusive image, ~Ssummer grass,~T that the power of the first
allusion is increased exponentially. The same words (actually a
compound Japanese word translated with grass in the plural) were used
by Matsuo Basho in 1689 as he envisioned the tragedy of a famous
battle that raged some five hundred earlier. Basho had tears in his
eyes when he wrote:

Summer grasses,
all that remains
of soldiers~R dreams. 1


One of the places Basho visited during his travels was Hiraizumi, the
setting for the battle of Ichi-no-Tani, the bitter culmination of a
brutal civil war fought in the late twelfth century between the Taira
and the Minamoto clans. The battle is considered one of the great
heroic tragedies of Japanese history. Stories of that era were
collected in the epic Heike Monogatari (The Tale of the Heike).

Basho is believed to have chosen the word 'natsukusa', translated as
~Ssummer grasses,~T in reference to that season~Rs oppressive heat
and humidity which transform the grasses of spring into rank
weeds~Wan appropriate image for the chaos and treachery of war. By
the time Basho visited Hiraizumi, weeds were all that remained where
once stood a great fortress. In his epic travel diary Oku no
Hosomichi (Narrow Road to the Interior), Basho comments:

~SIt was at Palace-on-the-Heights that Yoshitsune and his picked
retainers fortified themselves, but his glory turned in a moment into
this wilderness of grass. ~QCountries may fall, but their rivers and
mountains remain; when spring comes to the ruined castle, the grass
is green again.~R2 These lines went through my head as I sat on the
ground, my bamboo hat spread under me. There I sat weeping, unaware
of the passage of time.~T 3

I~Rd wager that Chad Lee Robinson felt a great sadness as well, when
he wrote the poem we chose for this issue~Rs Heron~Rs Nest Award. 

I don~Rt recall having read a haiku that alludes to more than one
historic event, as Robinson~Rs does. Not only does it do this, and to
great effect, but the Basho haiku referred to by one of Robinson~Rs
allusions is itself famous for the depth and poignancy of its
allusiveness. Quite a feat! I greatly admire what Chad Lee Robinson
has achieved with this haiku.
