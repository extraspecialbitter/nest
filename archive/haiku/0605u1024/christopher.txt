Hello Everyone,

Here is the May issue. It's ready for proofing and for uploading onto
the test site for
additional proofing.

I'll begin the printing process on Monday morning and will hold off on
printing the
pages with commentary until at least Tuesday or Wednesday so that we
have a little
more time to study it.

Thanks to all of you for all you do!

COMMENTARY

city heat^×
the grocer spritzes his greens
and little girls

Peter Yovu


With grit, grime, and traffic sounds stirred in, city heat can be
wiltingly oppressive. Every activity requires extra effort. Pavement
steams. Energy withers and tempers flare. Amid such discomforts, Peter
Yovu captures a refreshing moment of human activity that suggests a
whole way of life. A few words are enough to recreate the scene so
readers, too, can relish the squeals and laughter.

The grocery is small and makes careful use of every inch of space.
Otherwise, it would not survive economically, given the challenges of
urban rents and nearby competition. The grocer counts on attractive
fruits and vegetables to entice potential customers. Perhaps the produce
is displayed under an awning or within a roofed alcove just next to the
sidewalk. Keeping it fresh requires close attention. Spraying cool water
on cress, romaine, endive, and Boston lettuce is an important part of
the grocer's routine. His livelihood depends upon the appeal of those
greens.

Almost certainly this store is part of a real neighborhood where people
tend to know their grocer. Are the little girls the daughters of patrons
or passersby, or are they the grocer's own children? There are several
ways to read "his" in line two. It is possible that the poet himself is
a passer-by and doesn't know the answers to such questions. Haiku
usually leave much unsaid, allowing readers to continue the creative
process.

I like to imagine that this might be a family business. Maybe the family
lives above the store. That way of life is relatively rare now, but it
played a vital role in America's development. I wonder what accent I
might hear if Yovu's grocer spoke, and whether spritzing the girls has
become a part of his summer routine. Whatever the circumstances, his
gesture is endearing.

The playful redirection of the water provides an eye-opening surprise
for the poet and his readers as well as for the little girls. The power
of haiku to make us stop and take notice feeds ripples of sympathetic
awareness and encourages good will. Lightness and vitality sparkle
through the sludge of heat, and human spirit shines.
