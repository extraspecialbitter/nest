&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first snow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the snug fit of spices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in their rack<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            Burnell Lippy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In cooking up our little poems&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;our p&acirc;t&eacute;, our dim sum, our hot
cross buns&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;we have to get the recipes just right. Too much salt or
too little cream will be noticed. Undercooking or desiccation are
equally lamentable. On the other hand, a very small but successful
variation on an old familiar recipe can be enough to warrant our names
being added to that of the dish.
</p>
<p>
Burnell Lippy&#8217;s &#8220;first snow&#8221; economically captures the pleasure of
winter for those who are well prepared. One may eventually become
weary, as the season drags on, but the first snow is awesomely
beautiful. The poet/speaker here is &#8220;snug&#8221; inside, ready to enjoy the
domestic comforts of winter confinement.
</p>
<p>
This poem is successful in many of the ways that we have come to
appreciate in contemporary English-language haiku. Its images are
simply presented and register on the first reading. It has a single,
clear seasonal reference, a single clear break, and features natural
diction.
</p>
<p>
It is also a fine example of haiku&#8217;s ancestor, the <i>hokku</i> or
opening verse of the renku. In addition to exhibiting the qualities
that haiku inherited from the hokku, it exhibits other important
qualities of a hokku. It could be read as the renku leader&#8217;s
appreciation for the hospitality of a host. And it could also be an
optimistic invocation of the collaborative work to come&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;twelve,
twenty, or thirty-six verses&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;each with a place in the &#8220;rack&#8221; and each
containing a unique &#8220;spice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The common kigo &#8220;first snow&#8221; is a key ingredient in this poem and is
skillfully applied. The application of a formal kigo, especially one
that receives a great deal of use, obliges the poet to find ways of
refreshing the image. While western poetry has no element that quite
matches the function of the kigo, our use of spices in cooking provides
a useful parallel. Certain insights about the nature and qualities of
spices have come down to us through the generations, as both oral
tradition and written canon. These traditions are engaged with
innovations in an ongoing dialog, the beginning and ending of which are
equally beyond our sight. Some spices are in such common use that any
spice rack, however humble and rudimentary, is likely to include them:
thyme, cinnamon . . . and others so familiar to us that just a pinch
is enough to invoke intimate memories. Likewise, the use of the kigo
&#8220;first snow&#8221; will trigger some specific memories (even if unconscious
ones) in each of us.
</p>
<p>
When a spice rack is mentioned, we are likely to envision a
particular example, in our own kitchens or in the kitchens of our
childhoods. Even if some readers have no immediately retrievable
memories of such an object, it will likely prove evocative through the
absence of such associations. In fact, just such a negative capability
is one of the striking features of this poem. The spices are not, at
present, providing sensations of either taste or scent. They are
entirely a matter of potential in the moment portrayed, snug in their
storage place.
</p>
<p>
Juxtaposition is a primary tool of haiku poets. It&#8217;s easy for us to
fall into the extremes of selecting images that operate as either
synonyms or antonyms for each other. The results can be an
unacknowledged simile or a labored irony. Occasionally this can be
effective but best practice seems to be to work with images that are
plausibly available to the senses in a single instance of time and
place and to allow their resonances free play rather than to force them
into a narrow span of meaning. In other words, we show rather than
tell. But we are not limited to showing, we can also invite the reader
to get close enough to touch, taste, and smell.
</p>
<p>
 The good news is that the selection of one poem among the final
three was difficult this time. They all succeed in resisting the
reduction of their core images to a &#8220;solution.&#8221; Despite the
metaphorical possibilities of Michele Root-Bernstein&#8217;s empty hat box,
Claire Gallagher&#8217;s late season tomatoes, and Burnell Lippy&#8217;s spice
rack, each of these images retains its literal qualities and declines
to be made into something other, and lesser, than itself. Each is full
of implications, which arise as they do in life, suggesting rather than
proclaiming a deeper meaning. It only takes a trace of snow, or a bay
leaf, to release all of this for sensitive readers.
