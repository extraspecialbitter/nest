        POPULAR POETS<br>
        <br>
<p>
This category results from totaling the number of points awarded to each 
poet for their entire body of work in Volume IX. The most poems one can 
have accepted into <i>The Nest</i> each year is eight. Obviously, the more 
poems a person publishes, the more chances he or she has for garnering 
votes. It follows that success in the Readers&#8217; Choice Awards is 
significantly affected by a poet&#8217;s earlier success in having work 
accepted by the editors throughout the year. Two poets had eight poems in 
Volume IX. One poet had seven poems published and eight poets had six published.
</p>
<p>
To put into perspective how well the winners did: The average total points 
for combined works this year was 31.

On behalf of the Editors and Webmaster of <i>The Heron&#8217;s Nest</i>,
</p>
<p>
Applause for the winners of the 2007 Readers&#8217; Choice Awards for 
having written haiku with great power, leaving lasting impressions on 
so many of your peers!
</p>
<p>
Gratitude also to everyone whose haiku appeared in <i>The Heron&#8217;s 
Nest</i> last year. Your work passed through a team of five critical 
editors to get there.
