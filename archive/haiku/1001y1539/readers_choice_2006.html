Happily, it is now time to share with you the overall results of the 
Readers&#8217; Choice voting for favorite poems and most popular poets in 
<i>The Heron&#8217;s Nest</i>, Volume VIII, 2006. If you would like to read 
the entire awards issue, which includes the winning poems and poets along 
with commentary, special mentions, and many wonderful comments by voters 
(on individual poems and on the process in general), please order the paper 
edition of Volume VIII. 
</p>
<p>
This year&#8217;s paper edition of <i>The Heron&#8217;s Nest</i> also features a 
full-color cover (two winning photographs from the 2006 Illustration Contest) 
as well as the other winning paintings, drawings, prints, and photographs. 
Copies are due to be sent out during the first week of April. They&#8217;ll 
contain all four of last year&#8217;s issues plus the complete 
Readers&#8217; Choice Awards. For ordering information, please navigate to

I&#8217;m very pleased to announce that there was a record number of voters 
this year. Eighty-seven! That beats the old record of seventy-eight, set in 
2005. A hearty thank you to all of you who managed to find time to vote in 
a very busy season.
</p>
<p>
And now, here are the poems and poets you chose as favorites from 
<i>The Nests</i> of 2006. The Grand Prize winners will receive engraved 
plaques and runners-up will be awarded certificates. 
</p>
<p>
To put into perspective how well the winners did: 14 = the average point-score 
for a given poem.

        POPULAR POETS<br>
        <br>
<p>
This category results from totaling the number of votes awarded each poet 
for their entire body of work in Volume VIII. The most poems allowable in 
<i>The Nest</i> each year is eight. Obviously, the more poems a person has 
published, the more chances for garnering votes. So, success in the 
Readers&#8217; Choice Awards is significantly affected by a poet&#8217;s 
earlier successes in having work accepted by the editors throughout the year. 
No poet had eight poems in volume VIII. Seven poets had seven poems published 
and six poets had six published.   
</p>
<p>
To put into perspective how well the winners did: The average total points for combined works this year was 29.
</p>
<p>
Grand Prize  (38 total votes for 5 of 6 poems = 242 pts.)

A deep bow to the winning poets for penning haiku that have profoundly 
touched so many of us. We congratulate you, the winners of the 2006 
Readers&#8217; Choice Awards! 
</p>
<p>
We also applaud everyone whose worked appeared in <i>The Nest</i> last year. 
Your haiku passed through a team of five critical editors to get there.
</p>
