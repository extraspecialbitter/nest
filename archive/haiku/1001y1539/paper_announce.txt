Dear Friends and Readers of The Nest,

The paper edition of Volume IX is terrific! It has now been printed, bound, 
and, as promised, is now in the mail to those of you who ordered copies. 
I still have a good number of books on hand, so if you've been waiting 
to buy one until they were printed, wait no more. Just send your check 
or money order, made out to The Heron's Nest, to me at 816 Taft Street, 
Port Townsend, WA 98368 U.S.A.. The costs are as follows:

U.S. :  $16
Canada and Mexico : $18
Elsewhere:  $20

Good wishes to all,

Christopher Herold
