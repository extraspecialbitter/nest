Dear Nest Readers,

I have two reminders for you.

1) Beginning with this coming year, there'll be no February Heron's
Nests other than the annual Valentine Awards issue. The submissions we
receive from November 16 (this Sunday) to December 31 will be considered
for the March issue. We'll review those poems for March in the first
part of January and will respond in the middle of January. Submissions
we receive from January 1 to February 15 will be considered for the
April issue. We'll review those poems for April towards the end of
February and will respond at the end of February.

2) With the release of the December issue (on November 30) you'll be
invited to participate in the Valentine Awards voting. From December 1
until midnight, January 15, I'll be officially open to receiving your 10
favorite Heron's Nest poems from Volume V.  We hope that you've been
keeping track of your favorite poems this year so that narrowing down
your top ten will be easier. If not, well, I've been told many, many
times that one of the delightful gifts of the Valentine Awards is that
it prompts a revisiting of all the issues and that doing so proves to be
a most rewarding experience. So, even if you have been keeping track of
your favorites, it's fun to read those issues again.

With gratitude and best wishes,

Christopher Herold
