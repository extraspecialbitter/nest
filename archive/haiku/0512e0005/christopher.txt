Hi Everyone,

I now have the December Nest set up in both PageMaker and Word templates.
In addition to the usual pages of poems and commentary, I've included a
memorial page for three poets who passed away this year. All were
contributors
to The Nest. I selected two poems from each poet and all but one of these
six
was previously published in THN. The other (one of Bob Gibson's) I found
in his book Children of the Sparrow. If you think we need to credit that
book I'll
add a footnote but I'd rather not feel that we have to. It would clutter
the look
of the page, in paper anyway, and I very much doubt that anyone will
object
anyway. Please let me know what you think.

Below is the entire December Nest, ready to upload to the web-site and
for you
to proof. I hope you find it flawless.

B3, please let me know if adding the In Memorial is going to be a
problem.
Thanks.

Punchy

COMMENTARY

This wonderful haiku begins by setting a dream-like tone. The "faint
stars" imply a night sky that demands attention by virtue of its very
ambiguity. One knows that the stars are there, but there is something
obscuring that reality, leaving the reader in a state of muted
anticipation. Is it an overcast sky? The surface light from a city that
never sleeps? The possibilities far surpass the simplicity of the words
that imply them.

And then, the cabby speaks of home. A man with a lonely job, just trying
to make an innocent connection during the hustle and bustle of yet
another day. Perhaps English is not his first language, and his native
country on the other side of the planet. One imagines him engaging an
unwitting stranger in a decidely one-sided conversation, all in an
attempt to transcend the miles that separate him from home.

As one who grew up in New York in the seventies, two "taxi" themes are
permanently ingrained in my memory: Martin Scorsese^Òs Taxi Driver (1976)
and the song Taxi by Harry Chapin (1972).

In the movie Taxi Driver, Robert De Niro plays the part of Travis Bickle,
a loner who takes a job as a cabbie during the night shift because he is
an insomniac. He offers very few facts about his background. He is a 26
year-old ex-Marine with a clean driving record. He is a faceless person
in a crowded city. Out of an acute desire to somehow escape his isolated
life, he obsesses over a young campaign worker, played by Cybill
Shepherd, and then a child prostitute, played by Jodie Foster. In the
movie^Òs dramatic conclusion, the child is forcibly "rescued" from her
pimp and reunited with her family^×a homecoming that Bickle will likely
never experience himself.

Harry Chapin^Òs Taxi is sung in the first person, drawing the listener
into the story of a cabby, who by chance is reunited with an old flame.
The encounter reawakens the memory of their youthful aspirations: "She
was gonna be an actress, and I was gonna learn to fly." Their brief time
together concludes anticlimactically. Before the ride ends the two
would-be lovers are again safely distanced from their dreams and one
another: "There was not much more for us to talk about."

Timothy Hawkes^Ò cabby, under a canopy of thinly veiled stars, has a
similar vision of home^×a place of youthful ambition and endless
possibility. In seven brief words, this haiku is a portrait of nostalgia,
warmth, and ultimately, hope.
