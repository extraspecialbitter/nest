In Memory of Kylan Jones-Huffman

One of the editors from The Heron^Òs Nest met and wrote poems with U. S.
Navy Lieutenant Kylan Jones-Huffman. The rest of us knew and admired him
through his haiku. Now we all grieve. Lt. Jones-Huffman was gunned down
in Al Hillah, Iraq on Thursday, August 21. He sent the following poem (in
all likelihood one of his last) just three days prior to his death:

uncomfortable^×
body armor shifting
on the car seat
 
As a tribute to Kylan Jones-Huffman, we share a few more of his poems:

tea leaves steam
on the icy compost pile
winter sunrise

newborn calf
still wet, stands, trips,
stands again

raising her veil,
she sips fruit juice^×
the souk in summer

summer solstice^×
women in black abayas
wade in the sea

squirrel drinking
from one small puddle^×
tank tracks

twelve hour watch:
the morning threat report
in rhymed couplets

call to prayer^×
the waxing moon obscured
by a sandstorm

The Jones-Huffman family is graciously permitting us to present these
poems by Kylan. All have appeared on-line, three as part of the U. S.
Navy Literary Festival, and four from the Cricket list.
