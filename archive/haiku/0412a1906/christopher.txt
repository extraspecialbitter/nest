Hello Web Heron, how goes it?

I have here for you the December issue ready for inputting. It's pretty
well
tweaked but, as often is the case, there maybe a detail or three to
adjust
before going live.

I'll soon be sending you an announcement that must go out with the
December
Nest. It lets people know that voting season has begun. You'll see what
I mean
when you read the announcement. It's basically the same as what we put
out
last year. I just changed the volume number and year where they came up.

Now then, I am not sure what it's going to take for you to give readers
the
index they'll need to look for certain poet's work. But such an index
will most
certainly be necessary. You might be able to make use of the form Alex
created
last year. Just go to the the Volume Contents for Volume III and then
click on
2002 Valentine Awards Voting. Actually here's the URL:

<http://www.theheronsnest.com/haiku/thn_va.announce.03.html>

Then, in the "How to Vote" section, click on (Volume III poets). There
you'll
find the index of poets Alex created for Volume III. We'll need the same
sort
of thing for Volume IV.

Now I fear that may have not told you about this soon enough. I sure
don't
want to put you under any more pressure than you're already under.
Please
let me know what can be done.

By the way, although we editors are not eligible to vote, you most
certainly
are . . . if you have time that is.

Thanks for all you do Paul,

Christopher

COMMENTARY

 In 1993, dogs were reclassified as a subspecies of wolf (Canis lupus
familiarus). Technically, the oft-used term "wolf hybrid" is incorrect.
The word most accurately describing the more recent wolf/dog crosses is
simply "wolfdog."

 Although all dogs are subspecies of wolves, I simply cannot (will not)
dwell on the image of Billie Wilson^Òs "wolf" as a chihuahua. I prefer to
envision it as a malamute, a husky, or samoyed. For a little fun,
however, you might enjoy inserting your own choices of breed (try
several) in place of the word "dog^Òs" in this poem. I have, and I
discovered that each breed appreciably changes the feel of the
experience. The sort of dog each of us sees is not so important.
Specificity is a desirable quality in haiku, but not always and this
poem is a case in point. If Billie had designated a particular breed of
dog, the poem would have been weakened. There are two reasons. First, we
wouldn^Òt have the opportunity to imagine the dog for ourselves. Second,
the resonance struck by using a general term would be all but lost.
"Dog^Òs" allows us an intuitive realization: as winter approaches, the
primitive nature in all living things tends to come to the surface,
compelled by the natural instinct to survive.

 How interesting it is that the 23 degree tilt of the Earth^Òs axis, in
conjunction with our planet^Òs orbit around the sun, accounts for all of
the seasonal changes on the planet. From winter solstice to summer
solstice an expansion takes place, a great inhaling. Light increases,
energy increases, seeds sprout, animals give birth--life burgeons and
matures. From summer solstice to winter solstice there^Òs a contraction,
a six-month exhalation. Light and energy decrease. Life-giving fluids no
longer reach into extremities and things begin to dry and to shrivel.
Consciousness draws inward, focused more and more intently on
self-preservation.

 I can see this in the eyes of the poet^Òs dog. Here is a pet accustomed
to having its needs provided by humans--a bowl of food once or twice a
day, the water bowl filled regularly, a soft pad to sleep on when its
people retire for the night. Leftovers may be offered. There might be a
bone to gnaw. Then, of course, there^Òs the pleasure of being petted. In
short, pets often lead pretty cushy lives. But deep inside the tamest of
pets is something perfectly primitive, something that will invariably
come to the surface as circumstances warrant. Billie Wilson lives in
Alaska, a place that is still very wild. Winters there are long and
harsh. One must be resourceful to survive in such a climate, both
physically and emotionally. It^Òs easy to go stir-crazy when the mercury
drops way down, the sun barely rises (or doesn^Òt rise at all), and one
is compelled to spend much time inside. Relationships are put to the
test. Winter!

 Some of you have heard the story about two monks who are watching a
flag. One says that the flag is moving; the other argues that it^Òs the
wind. When their teacher happens by, they ask him to settle the matter.
"Neither of you is right," the teacher says, "It is mind that moves."
Billie Wilson^Òs poem reminded me of this story. Is it wolfness in the
dog^Òs eyes, or is it winter? Is this wolf/winter in the dog^Òs eyes or
the poet's? By pointing to one specific manifestation of winter^Òs
approach, Billie effectively implies this movement is on a much grander
scale.
