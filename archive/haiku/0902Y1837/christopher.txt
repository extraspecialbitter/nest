Subject: The June Nest

Dear Herons,
Here is the complete June Nest.

B3, I give this to you about two-and-a-half weeks earlier than usual,
something I'd like to continue in the future. This should provide you
with adequate lead-time for a more leisurely formatting of the web
edition, especially in issues that contain a memorial tribute, as this
one does. And this memorial even has a photograph. I'll place the photo
(a jpeg) where it's meant to go in the text below. I can also send it
separately or make changes to it if you need me to. Also, I'll be holding
all necessary edits that come in from today on for a couple more weeks,
until I'm sure there's nothing else that needs changing. I'll then send
you those adjustments in one document.

And for you, my fine-feathered editor buddies, the June issue is now in
your hands for proofing. Later this month, when B3 gets everything up and
ready, we can proof it some more. Please get out those red pencils,
particularly for the memorial tribute since that's something you've not
seen as yet. I don't think we'll be free to change anything significant
but there may be typos, arrangement suggestions, or suggestions for
additional material. Whatever. I do hope you like it.

Without further ado, her 'tis!

Enjoy!

punchy thwack, at your service

COMMENTARY

late summer
no place in the corn
where you^Òre not touched
Burnell Lippy

Endlessly evocative, Burnell Lippy's ^Ólate summer / no place in the corn
/ where you're not touched^Ô should be read first and foremost as an
intensely physical declaration of fact from someone who knows exactly
what he is talking about. ^ÓLate summer^Ô is not a separate image but an
essential part of the statement, which would be untrue at a different
time of year. Adding ^ÓIn^Ô at the beginning, ^Óthere is^Ô after
^Ósummer,^Ô and a final period would transpose the elliptical expression
into a standard prose sentence. In that form, too, the information is
demonstrably accurate and richly compressed. The more forceful three-line
form, however, emphasizes Lippy^Òs poetic impulse and intent. It slows
things down just enough for the reader to step in.

 

The period of incredibly rapid growth has passed, and the corn is as tall
as it will ever be, seven maybe eight feet high, certainly well above a
person^Òs head. Banner-like leaves curve upward from the stalks then
droop, taking up most of the room between rows. Earth, corn, and heat
meld to produce heavy smells and ever-changing sounds unique to the
season and the crop. Greens dominate, accented by browns and yellows and
glimpses of sky. The plants move with their own weight and there is
absolutely no place within the cornfield where a human being would not
be brushed by leaves or leaning stalks^×itchy, scratched, nicked^×and
utterly surrounded by the ancient, amazing crop. A person could get lost
there, or feel he has been found and claimed.

 

The indefinite ^Óyou^Ô can be tricky, but here I think it sets just the
right tone, more inclusive than ^ÓI,^Ô much more natural and
conversational than ^Óone.^Ô The usage catches a wrung-from-the-poet
epiphany and establishes the universal quality of the insight. As a
reader or listener becomes thoroughly involved, the sense of the second
person pronoun may even shift from indefinite to specific, increasing the
intimacy of shared experience.   

 

Beyond paraphrase and beyond metaphor, the poem affects me emotionally as
well as physically. Alive to the present moment, I am touched by the
cycle of seasons and connections with people of many cultures and times.
I know that corn has been cultivated for centuries, changed, developed,
and spread around the world to become an economic giant and an essential
source of food for humans and livestock. I am touched by feelings of
responsibility as well as gratitude and abundance. Fertility, growth,
change, ripeness all brush my consciousness. 

 

Immersed in Burnell Lippy^Òs splendid haiku, I respond to the tactile
sensations of a cornfield in late summer and find myself insistently
touched by the mystery of life.

REMEMBERING KAY F. ANDERSON
July 29, 1934 ^× February 8, 2007

Kay Anderson was an embodiment of love, joy, and compassion. These, she
expressed without favoritism and without inhibition. Her mere presence
was an inspiration. In the last few years, Kay was a warrior in her
battle with cancer. She turned the disease back on itself, making of it a
reason to live more fully and more passionately. When she walked into a
room, the energy increased, the light seemed brighter. If I was asked to
name an ideal couple, two people who demonstrated how loving and
supportive a  marriage could be, the first people who would come to mind
would be Kay and her husband, John. There really are no words that convey
what a blessing our friendship has been. Kay^Òs haiku will always be with
me. She mastered the brush too, as those who have seen her exquisite
haiga can attest.

          drifts on the inkstone

Because Kay^Òs life had a profound affect on so many of us, the responses
to her passing have been both fervent and numerous. We now raise our
voices to thank Kay. May her spirit hear us and rejoice. ^×Christopher
Herold


* * * * * * * 

I admired Kay^Òs bravery and have long been inspired by her affirmation
of life and struggle to embrace every moment she could grasp. ^×Peggy

Kay F. Anderson, Life-Dancer

 

Those who met Kay Anderson couldn^Òt help but be changed by her spirit of
joy. I first met her in the early 1990s at a meeting of the Haiku Poets
of Northern California in San Francisco. When Christopher Herold and I
were editing the group^Òs journal Woodnotes, the first poem we published
by her, from issue #14 (Autumn, 1992), was this:

 

rainy day^×
sharing my bread
with a peg-leg grackle

 

In 1993, I was drawn to take a class in sumi-e brush painting in Redwood
City. Much to my surprise, when I showed up at the first class, there was
Kay! She stuck with it and over the years many haiku poets have seen her
heartfelt work. At the time of the class, she would have been nearly
sixty years old, still learning, still eager to try something new.
Here^Òs a poem by Kay from Woodnotes #18 (Autumn, 1993):

 

first sumi-e lesson^×
what I need
is the teacher^Òs brush

 

Kay was also my nearest haiku neighbour for many years. She and I lived
next to salt-water lagoons in Foster City and Redwood Shores, towns right
next to each other along San Francisco Bay. We^Òd occasionally get
together and share poems, and her poems were often about the birds she
saw from her back deck. Often her haiku expressed a profound, selfless
empathy (the following one winning second prize in the 1996 Henderson
Haiku Contest sponsored by the Haiku Society of America):

 

deep silence
      the orphaned nestlings
      this third morning

 

Yet she wrote vividly about many other topics. I once shared the
following poem of Kay^Òs with a friend who had just been divorced. My
friend immediately wanted a copy for herself:

 

five years
in the wrong window:
the violet^Òs first bloom

 

When my wife and I moved north to Seattle, Kay and I kept in touch by
e-mail. She took particular delight in my becoming a new father and
enjoyed the stories I shared about my two young children. Her positive
outlook came, I believe, from an innate youthfulness, always seeing the
world as just beginning, as full of hope. She valued the joy of youth,
and encouraged me to savour it in my children. She said my son and
daughter had changed me, and she was right. And so had she^×for the same
reasons. I like to think that something of her joy made it into this poem
of mine:

 

first star . . .
a seashell held
to my baby^Òs ear

The preceding picture is my favourite of Kay, taken in September of 2002
at the beach near the Asilomar conference center in Pacific Grove,
California, at the Yuki Teikei Haiku Society^Òs annual retreat. What a
sparkle in her eyes! Her ready smile and the twirl of her arms expressed
her joy at being alive^×despite her diagnosis of melanoma. I love how she
wanted to be barefoot^×not just at the beach that early autumn day but in
all of life, to not hold herself back from life^Òs full experience. She
was a life-dancer. This unguarded moment on the beach is the way I want
to remember her: ever and always as a life-dancer. It was the last time I
saw her.

I went down to Redwood City to see Kay a couple of weeks before she
slipped into a coma. I consider myself so fortunate to have had that time
with her, when she was still alert enough that we could laugh and cry
together. I feel so grateful for that hour in her presence. Even then she
was saying things like, ^ÓIf you ever need to talk, just call me.^Ô Then
she'd catch herself talking about the future as if there were going to be
one, and she'd say, ^ÓOh my God, listen to me.^Ô And we'd both cry. Our
dear friend Kay Anderson, beautiful writer, haiku poet and visual artist,
never hesitated to share the gift of her unconditional love with those
who came into her life. The world will be a much sorrier place without
her.

I discovered Kay at my first attendance of a Haiku Poets of Northern
California, Two Autumns reading. I was so impressed with her zest for
haiku that I just couldn't help but think I wanted to write and read like
her when I grow up. Not only was her poetry full of life, so was she. I
was impressed with her enthusiasm and her delivery. Of one of her poems
she even remarked, ^ÓI think I finally got this one right.^Ô It made me
realize that no matter how practiced one was with haiku, it was still a
challenge to get that moment right. She showed me haiku need not be
delivered in monotone. I^Òve been trying to emulate her ever since. Haiku
is full of color and she showed me that. She will be sorely missed.

Kay F. Anderson was one of my closest haiku and tanka friends. Although,
we never met in person, I knew her through her poetry, artwork, letters
and e-mails. I understood her spirit, her faith and her deep love of
god. She was truly a gift from God and I shall miss her deeply, but, I
will see her again in heaven.

My longtime friend Kay F. Anderson inspired me with her winged spirit and
open heart. She inhabited her days fully with joy and grace. 

In my poem honoring Kay^Òs passing, I use the term ^Óflying white.^Ô It
is a sumi-e brush technique. The stroke of a brush in the hands of a
skilled artist can produce deep black, threaded by pure white.

Once upon a time I was getting ready for my first Two Autumns (as a
reader.) I had written a poem^× It pleased me, and yet . . .

each tremor from the road
against my chest

I thought there was more to it, but what? At my limits, I turned to Kay
(who was editing the book from that Two Autumn^Òs reading).

^ÓThrough me.^Ô was all she said.

The earth fell away. ^ÓWhat is that?^Ô said I.

^ÓZen^Ô said Kay.

Kay Anderson was a dear friend. I want to share with you a tanka that Kay
wrote, which I regard as her ^Ódeath poem.^Ô I know The Heron's Nest is
only for haiku, but I wonder if you might consider this as an exception. 
(Yes Linda, we sure will.)

The Gifts  of Kay Anderson

(a haibun by Kay Anderson and Patricia J. Machmiller)

 

1993^×It was my first ^Óreal^Ô haiku reading^×the annual Two Autumns
event sponsored by the Haiku Poets of Northern California. One of the
other readers was that dynamic and exuberant, that unforgettable Kay
Anderson. She made the reading a stellar show.

 

the red-tailed hawk
riding
Indian summer haze

 

This was her way. Since that time, over the years I have attended almost
every Two Autumns reading. Her second reading stands out in my mind as
among the best. She is there in flowing turquoise; each haiku is
delivered with eloquence, like a gift to the audience, specially wrapped.

 

between crutches
one leg and his knee stump
into the surf!

 

I think it was after she had been diagnosed with melanoma that she
learned of Kiyoko Tokutomi^Òs descent into Alzheimer^Òs. Even though her
own battle demanded 110% of her concentration and energy, she reached out
and arranged for a jinjitsu session for Kiyoko (literally ^ÓHuman
Day,^Ô which includes ^Óthe feast of seven herbs,^Ô from the custom of
eating seven-herb to ensure good health for the coming year). Not that
jinjitsu would heal Kiyoko^Òs tangled mind, but that through her body,
she could receive solace, love, and above all, grace. It was a unique and
very thoughtful gift.

 

rainy day^×
sharing my bread
with a peg-leg grackle

 

This is the Kay I know^×the one who lives life to the fullest, who gives
herself wholly, and who adds zest to the soul, hers and to all she comes
in contact with. 

 

on the wrong train^×
nose against the window
laughing

And even though she has transitioned to a new state, her presence is
still vividly felt, her voice still distinctly heard in her haiku.

blossoming almonds^×
the valley where she lived
the valley where she has gone

 

[Note: all the haiku in this haibun except the last are Kay Anderson^Òs
from Morning Snow, Two Autumns Press, 1993.]
