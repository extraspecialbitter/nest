More Tributes to Kay F. Anderson<br>

Once upon a time I was getting ready for my first Two Autumns (as a reader.) 
I had written a poem&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;It pleased me, and yet . . . 
<blockquote>
seatbelt tightened <br>
each tremor from the road<br>
against my chest
</blockquote>
I thought there was more to it, but what? At my limits, I turned to Kay 
(who was editing the book from that Two Autumns reading).</p>
<p>
&#8220;Through me.&#8221; was all she said.
</p><p>
The earth fell away. &#8220;What is that?&#8221; said I.
</p><p>
&#8220;Zen&#8221; said Kay.
<blockquote>
seatbelt tightened&nbsp;&#8212;<br>
each tremor from the road<br>
through me
</blockquote>
Thank you Kay, &nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;Laurie Stoelting

Kay Anderson was a dear friend. I want to share with you a tanka that Kay 
wrote, which I regard as her &#8220;death poem.&#8221; I know The Heron&#8217;s 
Nest is only for haiku, but I wonder if you might consider this as an 
exception.  <i>(Yes Linda, we sure will.)</i>
<blockquote>
when my whole note<br>
and the universe are ready<br>
there will be a tap<br>
on my shoulder&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;and my song<br>
shall fly beyond me
<br><br>
&#8212;&nbsp;Kay Anderson (<i>Red Lights</i>: Vol. 2, No. 2, June 2006)

<blockquote>
Maui sunrise<br>
through a crack of stone<br>
a new pine

The Gifts of Kay Anderson<br>
</b></font></p>
(a haibun by Kay Anderson and Patricia J. Machmiller)</p>
<p> 
1993&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;It was my first &#8220;real&#8221; haiku reading
&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;the annual Two Autumns event sponsored by the Haiku Poets 
of Northern California. One of the other readers was that dynamic and 
exuberant, that unforgettable Kay Anderson. She made the reading a stellar show.
<blockquote> 
the red-tailed hawk<br>
riding<br>
Indian summer haze
</blockquote> 
This was her way. Since that time, over the years I have attended almost 
every Two Autumns reading. Her second reading stands out in my mind as among 
the best. She is there in flowing turquoise; each haiku is delivered with 
eloquence, like a gift to the audience, specially wrapped.
<blockquote> 
between crutches<br>
one leg and his knee stump<br>
into the surf!
</blockquote>
I think it was after she had been diagnosed with melanoma that she learned 
of Kiyoko Tokutomi&#8217;s descent into Alzheimer&#8217;s. Even though her 
own battle demanded 110% of her concentration and energy, she reached out 
and arranged for a jinjitsu session for Kiyoko (literally &#8220;Human Day,&#8221;
which includes &#8220;the feast of seven herbs,&#8221; from the custom of 
eating seven-herb to ensure good health for the coming year). Not that 
jinjitsu would heal Kiyoko&#8217;s tangled mind, but that through her body, 
she could receive solace, love, and above all, grace. It was a unique and 
very thoughtful gift.
<blockquote> 
rainy day&nbsp;&#8212;<br>
sharing my bread<br>
with a peg-leg grackle
</blockquote>
This is the Kay I know&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;the one who lives life to the 
fullest, who gives herself wholly, and who adds zest to the soul, hers 
and to all she comes in contact with. 
<blockquote> 
on the wrong train&nbsp;&#8212;<br>
nose against the window<br>
laughing
</blockquote>
And even though she has transitioned to a new state, her presence is still vividly felt, her voice still distinctly heard in her haiku.
<blockquote>
blossoming almonds&nbsp;&#8212;<br>
the valley where she lived<br>
the valley where she has gone
<br><br>
&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;Patricia Machmiller
</blockquote>

from <i>Morning Snow</i>, Two Autumns Press, 1993.]</font>
