More Tributes to Kay F. Anderson<br>

I went down to Redwood City to see Kay a couple of weeks before she slipped 
into a coma. I consider myself so fortunate to have had that time with her, 
when she was still alert enough that we could laugh and cry together. 
I feel so grateful for that hour in her presence. Even then she was saying 
things like, &#8220;If you ever need to talk, just call me.&#8221; Then 
she&#8217;d catch herself talking about the future as if there were going 
to be one, and she&#8217;d say, &#8220;Oh my God, listen to me.&#8221; And 
we&#8217;d both cry. Our dear friend Kay Anderson, beautiful writer, haiku 
poet and visual artist, never hesitated to share the gift of her 
unconditional love with those who came into her life. The world will be a 
much sorrier place without her.
</p>

I discovered Kay at my first attendance of a Haiku Poets of Northern 
California, Two Autumns reading. I was so impressed with her zest for haiku 
that I just couldn&#8217;t help but think I wanted to write and read like 
her when I grow up. Not only was her poetry full of life, so was she. I was 
impressed with her enthusiasm and her delivery. Of one of her poems she 
even remarked, &#8220;I think I finally got this one right.&#8221; It made 
me realize that no matter how practiced one was with haiku, it was still a 
challenge to get that moment right. She showed me haiku need not be delivered 
in monotone. I&#8217;ve been trying to emulate her ever since. Haiku is full 
of color and she showed me that. She will be sorely missed.

Kay F. Anderson was one of my closest haiku and tanka friends. Although 
we never met in person, I knew her through her poetry, artwork, letters and 
e-mails. I understood her spirit, her faith and her deep love of God. 
She was truly a gift from God and I shall miss her deeply, but, I will 
see her again in heaven.

My longtime friend Kay F. Anderson inspired me with her winged spirit and 
open heart. She inhabited her days fully with joy and grace.</p> 
<p>
In my poem honoring Kay&#8217;s passing, I use the term &#8220;flying 
white.&#8221; It is a sumi-e brush technique. The stroke of a brush in the 
hands of a skilled artist can produce deep black, threaded by pure white.
