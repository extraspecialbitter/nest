Randy M. Brooks
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Randy Brooks believes &#147;that every haiku has within it a
confirmation of the human heart being fully alive.&#148;*  This one certainly
does. The fluid tai chi movements match the soft unfolding of morning
glories. A new day begins. The participatory presence of the poet's wife
completes the joy.
</P>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Arms and legs open and close. The couple inhale and exhale, their
diaphragms rising and falling as they relax into the ancient dance-like
postures. They sense a connection with nature and inclusion in the cycle
of days, seasons, years. Present moments, fully lived, expand into
timelessness.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tai chi could be performed by a couple of any age. Millions of
Chinese people, many of them well into their nineties, gather outdoors
every morning to &#147;move the chi.&#148; Practitioners credit the regimen with
sustaining physical fitness, increasing mental alertness, and
encouraging spiritual awakening. Practice puts them in touch with the
vital energy of the body. Because the haiku is signed and I know the
poet, I visualize Randy and Shirley Brooks instead of an elderly Chinese
man and woman. I know that their marriage is strong and of long
duration. Clearly this is a love poem, a beautiful tribute to the poet's
wife. I have no sense, though, of intruding upon a private moment. The
haiku is both restrained and expansive. The harmony it celebrates
comfortably includes the reader.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The morning glory is an early autumn kigo in Japan. In America it
has a long blooming season and is likely to be prominent from July
through October or even longer. The language of poetry encourages us to
imagine a particular morning in late summer or early autumn and a
similar season in the lives of the people portrayed. That tai chi is a
lifetime art suggests associations with the continuity of this
particular marriage and the promise of the relationship's opening
through all seasons to the possibilities of each new day.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Kigo connect individual haiku to others that use the same images,
creating a powerful literary context that can add layers of meaning and
ongoing resonance. Here are three of my favorites about morning glories:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In Japanese this flower is called asagao, which translates as
&#147;morning face.&#148; The subtle difference reminds me that while haiku has
become a universal genre, the languages in which it is composed and read
will add their nuances and patinas. That is as it should be. Each superb
haiku about morning glories will find a unique place among the others.
Randy's new one interacts meaningfully with the three classics. The
editors of The Heron's Nest are pleased to begin the year 2003 by
sharing it with our readers.
