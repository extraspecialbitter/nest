TIME TO VOTE!

Dear Friends, Readers, and Heron's Nest contributors,

The December issue of The Heron's Nest (our last in Volume VIII) is now 
available for your reading pleasure at <http://www.theheronsnest.com/>. 
With the release of this issue comes the opportunity for you to decide 
which poems are your favorites that we published this past year. The 
results will be published in the annual paper edition due out in late 
March. If you haven't ordered a copy, we hope you plan to soon.

HOW TO VOTE:

Review all Volume VIII poems by navigating to the "Volume Contents" page: 
<http://www.theheronsnest.com/haiku/>. There you'll find the quarterly issues 
with their respective haiku pages and indices of poets. Read through each of 
the issues and create a list of your favorite poems. Then narrow the field to 
just ten. Rank those ten in your order of preference with the first being 
your top choice. All poems in the quarterly issues of Volume VIII are eligible 
except for poems included in memorials, poems written by The Heron's Nest 
editors or web-master and, of course, you may not vote for your own work. 
A Master List of poets who contributed work to Volume VIII will soon be 
created for you. It should prove helpful in locating poems by particular poets.

Send your chosen list of poems to Managing Editor, Christopher Herold at
<theheronsnest@cablespeed.com/> .

DEADLINE: January 15, 2007.
