Subject: THN: THE DECEMBER ISSUE

Dear Herons,

I've pasted the December issue below in its entirety,
ready for uploading and proofing.

Boston Bird, as you already know, this issue contains
the additional element of a memorial. This one is a
fairly long one so I'm not sure how you want to handle
it. In the limited paper issue it takes up six pages. Looking
back to the web memorial you put together for Elizabeth 
Lamb, I see that you created four pages:

1	index of contributors
2	tributes that involve prose as well as tribute haiku
3	individual haiku from contributors
4	a selection of Elizabeth's haiku

This new memorial for Francine might be divided in the
same way. In the paper issue I've further divided the
prose +  haiku section into those from contributors
and those from us, the Nest staff. If you could also do
that, it would be great. But, if that seems like more
work than you are able to handle, you could add our
prose/haiku tributes to the end of those from contributors. 
I leave this all to your infinite wisdom.

Okay y'all, now, on to The Nest itself. Here it is. Those
of you who can could start proofing at will. The Boston
Bird will have to set his own pace to get this plugged into
his template and ready for our scrutiny at that level
of readiness.

Enjoy! 

Punchy

Commentary

winter wind--
a cradlesong sung
in an ancient tongue
                                   Billie Wilson


Haiku is a poetry not of the mind or invention, but of experience. When the subject of a haiku involves a major human emotion such as love, it is the writer's challenge not to overwhelm the poem. Haiku writing is a way of seeing the world and expressing an insight in a manner as unadorned by the poet's opinion as possible.

Death, grief, and love are certainly parts of life and as such are subjects for haiku. But what is love? The ancient Greeks used three words for love: eros, agape, and philia. Eros as love should be obvious. Agape was used by early Christians more specifically than "altruism" alone. The word came to mean love of God, or God's love. In addition to "brotherly" love, Aristotle described philia as showing love by a parent. It is this most basic perhaps original bond among humans that Billie Wilson has indicated to the reader.

In the here and now of Wilson's clear images, it is winter. We can hear the wind, see its effects, and sense the cold.  Next to consider is "cradlesong." This is the crux of the haiku; it is the genius of the poem. All at once, so simply, we can hear a lullaby and know that an infant is being comforted. The rocking cradle or the embrace of a family member's arms is a warm place sheltered from the elements. Is the cradle an heirloom?  Is there a handmade quilt? The position of the infant is not clear nor need it be.  Like so much in this haiku, this is open to interpretation according to the life experiences of different readers. Just what language is sung is unanswered. By leaving this out, the author allows each of us to look even further into our own traditions. My first thought was of some Native American language. My ancestors surely sang in Gaelic. It could be Hebrew, Greek, Chinese, or almost any language ^×even a European one.  

I used to sing to my daughter; my wife did; so too did various older women in the family. My wife's maternal grandmother was the family champion. Sick child? One who won't relax and go to sleep? Just make the handoff to Grandma Willoughby. Edith would croon softly in an unlovely yet effective voice. Sometimes she would walk around the room to the beat of her droning melodies. I also saw this comfort given to various nieces and nephews. In my vision of the poem the singer was between 85 and 95 years old as she worked her magic.

Billie Wilson's craft employs expansive words and has them in the right order. The sound of the harsh wind is juxtaposed in fine balance with comfort and safety.

Cannot we all hear it? Familial love is such an ancient song.

FRANCINE PORAD MEMORIAL

[Note to B3:  The first part is comprised of short prose tributes, each with a poem] 

Remembering

Francine Joy Porad

September 3, 1929 ^× September 27, 2006

Francine was my dear friend for more than twenty years.We worked together weekly from 1988-1995 producing Brussels Sprout. I miss her phone calls and frequent query, ^ÓDo you have time for one haiku?^Ô I treasure the sharing that resulted as we discussed nuance, word choice and order, conversations that often led to jokes and stories. Her paintings and writings continue to remind me of her talent, drive, warmth, and generosity.

Connie Hutchison

Again we are reminded that we have a limited visa for life on this earth. Another of our beloved haiku poets has entered a new dimension. Having published a ^Ófirst haiku^Ô for many of us, Francine^Òs Brussels Sprout journal painted a path where we were warmly invited to journey. Remaining forever close to us, Francine Porad^Òs dynamic life and spirit continue to pulsate throughout the haiku world.

Kay Anderson

Losing those we love is not easy.  Francine's spirit will live forever, in our hearts and in our minds. I met her for the first time at [a ginko] in the Bloedel Reserve. Her warm smile was the first thing I noticed. Then she took my hand and introduced herself.  My heart pounded, and I'm quite sure I fumbled with trying to introduce myself.

Connie Donleycott

Francine was the first editor I approached with my haiku. She rejected them, firmly but in such a nurturing and encouraging fashion that I was encouraged to try again and again. Now that I am working as a haiku editor myself, Francine is one of my most frequently invoked models. I'm doing my best to pass along what she gave me, with some of the warmth and humor that was so evident in her editorial work and in her poetry. This poem is one I wrote on the day I first met Francine and is one I know she liked very much:

Francine was my first mentor in haiku, and I have loved her dearly for a long time. Ten years ago, her spot-on advice, generosity, and unfailing diplomacy put me on the right haiku path. Though we never met in person, Francine was a beloved friend over the years.

wind rising
where a willow once wept
suddenly the stars
Ferris Gilli

Francine and I only met once, but I had know her for years via the Internet and perhaps always. I once reminisced: ^ÓMany mango seasons ago when I arrived on the Shiki Salon doorstep as a foundling in a basket swaddled with a week-old sports section, many haiku poets took me in and attended to my needs. Each appeared to me, in my cradle, and murmured their special words and insights.^Ô One such was Francine Porad. She was generous with insight and straight talk . . . actions of kindness, actions of a teacher. And^×she was a lot of fun! As part of some repartee, Francine once wrote: ^ÓBy my poems you will know me.^Ô

autumn storm
a great cedar blocks
the sweeping wind
Paul MacNeil

I^Òm probably one of many haiku poets who could say with 100% sincerity that Francine gave me my start in haiku, patiently enduring my enthusiastic but sophomoric early posts and providing true encouragement. I had the opportunity to meet her in person only once, but her influence on my writing endures.

windless night^×
so many leaves
at the foot of the tree
Paul David Mena

As she did for many other poets, Francine published my first submitted haiku in Brussels Spout. Our friendship began right away and grew steadily. I think we learned the most about each other while writing renku together. When I moved to the Seattle area, Francine welcomed my wife and me into the Haiku Northwest group as if we were part of her family. Indeed the group was, and still is, Francine^Òs extended family. We are so fortunate to have her legacy of poems, paintings, and so many fine memories, especially of her nurturing ways, her keen insights, and her oh-so-dry wit. Francine will always live in my heart.

Francine was a wonderfully generous person and one of haiku^Òs best friends. I am saddened by the loss and grateful for her life.
