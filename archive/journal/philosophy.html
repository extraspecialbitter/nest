Introduction
</STRONG>
</P>

<P>
The Heron's Nest is a journal of haiku and linked verse that embody
traditional spirit. As editor of this journal, I'd like you to know my
thoughts about haiku so that you can decide if you'd like to visit more
often, or perhaps submit your work to me. I also want to tell you about
The Heron's Nest live-on-line chat room in which we can regularly
discuss, and write haikai forms together. First of all, here are some of
my thoughts about haiku. They'll help you get to know what I look for in
the work that comes to me.
</P>

<P>
As you probably know, there are long lists of dos and don'ts associated
with haiku, set forth by the Japanese who originated the form, and by
westerners attempting to emulate them. And there is, of course, much
difference of opinion as to the relative importance of these dos and
don'ts. Which, if any, must be followed at all cost? Which are
expendable? There are poets who follow a strict 5-7-5 syllabic pattern,
and include a single seasonal reference. There are poets who do neither,
yet still craft equally short, and much shorter poems. In either case,
skillful syntax, and important concepts such as "artlessness" (no
contrivance), reverence of the commonplace, of the imperfect, of the
transitory, and interpenetrating the objects of our inspiration, are
essential elements to creating good haiku, and for assimilating the
maximum of what haiku has to offer. In other words, the depth and spirit
of haiku can be achieved in either approach to form.
</P>

<P>
Above all, I believe that tradition should be honored, but not to the
exclusion of innovation. And I believe that that can be accomplished in
several ways. One way is to write haiku in which the 5-7-5 form, and
inclusion of a seasonal reference are of paramount importance, yet in
which the life and spirit still shine. Another way to evoke haiku spirit
is to write poems in which the experience dictates the form, even if the
poems don't approximate the 5-7-5 syllabic structure, and/or don't
contain a seasonal reference.
</P>

<P>
There is another way to embody haiku spirit in a poem. It is to
amalgamate the practices mentioned above, and I highly recommend this
for one simple and important reason: it honors the gift of tradition, at
the same time that it honors our own unique, personal experiences. There
is more than one way this can be accomplished. One is to begin each poem
with a sincere and tenacious attempt to hold to original form (5-7-5 and
one seasonal reference). Then ease the grip on  "rules" and concentrate
completely on the experience. If necessary, the form should be
compromised to uphold the truth of the experience, and bring it into the
clearest possible focus. Another way is to do the same thing in reverse.
Begin by clarifying the experience, even if the result is a short
paragraph, or maybe just three words on the page. Then bring what is
there into line with traditional form. Sometimes the "bringing into
line" will improve the original poem by utilizing the richness of the
language, and sometimes it will diminish the poem by adding unnecessary
words, or taking away essential words. At this point it must be decided
which way the truth of the experience is best represented. To practice
writing in this way is to honor the spirit at the heart of haiku,
regardless of whether the resultant poem is a haiku or not.
</P>

<P>
Tenacity in the struggle to stick to traditional form, coupled with
determination not to lose the core experience, results in a more
thorough digestion and better understanding of the experience, the haiku
form, and most importantly, of ourselves. It also results in a more
satisfying, readily accessible poem. Whether or not a poem turns out to
be 5-7-5, or contain a seasonal reference, is of secondary importance in
light of the poet's efforts to learn and to honor tradition, and to
balance tradition with his or her unique form of expression.
</P>

<P>
For these reasons, it is my intention that The Heron's Nest be a
journal that presents haiku in which I feel that the poet has made a
sincere attempt to honor tradition. To accomplish this, I'll post two
streams of work, plus a list of my five favorite poems submitted. The
first stream will consist of haiku that have a 5-7-5 structure (give or
take a syllable), and contain a single kigo. The second stream will
consist of free-style haiku.  My primary criteria for the top five haiku
will be depth of spirit, and ease of accessibility to that spirit. You
may submit at any time, but new postings, and changes to the top five,
will be made on a weekly basis. In this way I'll have sufficient time to
really sink into each poem.
</P>

<P>
Thank you for coming to The Heron's Nest. I hope you enjoy what you find
and share what you have.
