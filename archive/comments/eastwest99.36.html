Dear Friends and Fellow Sculptors of the Microcosmic World known as The
East - West '99 Renku,
</P>

<P>
I have for you the ageku, the final piece of the puzzle, we have so
enthusiastically assembled. Of the twenty-six candidates submitted, many
of which were very, very good, I felt that there were three outstanding
stanzas. After careful scrutiny the chosen one leaped out to take its
place as the final poem of East - West '99. The honor goes to Sandra
Fuhringer for her verse:
</P>

<P>
a door standing open<BR>
to the slow spring rain
</P>

<P>
It is an invitation to enjoy eternity, to appreciate our wealth of
opportunities, an invitation, not only to the newlyweds in Kiyoko's
stanza, but to us all. This verse has such powerful resonance! It
carries us, from the life time of East - West '99 right out through the
open door, into the spring rain. Sandra welcomes the rain, to delight
our senses, to see, hear, and smell it, to become wet by it. What a
welcoming of life. Many thanks go to Sandra for this open-hearted
embrace.
</P>

<P>
We have now finished what we started out to do, create a kasen renku of
historic proportions. East - West '99 began with the first ever hokku
contest outside of Japan. It then continued at Haiku North America in
Evanston, Illinois, garnering several verses and recruiting a few
curious poets. After the conference, verses were added via e-mail until
Saturday, July 31, when we held  the second ever live-on-line renku
party. Present at the party were two groups of poets (one in Richmond,
California, and one in Port Townsend, Washington), and several
individuals, all told about seventeen poets. The party lasted for more
than nine hours, during which nineteen verses were added. In addition to
the two groups, there were poets on-line in Maine, Florida, Washington,
California, and Canada. And that was only during the live session!
</P>

<P>
In reading our poem, I get the clear sense that we have been very
successful indeed. My feelings at this point are, first of all, deep
gratitude, and second, emptiness, knowing that are journey together, at
least for now, has reached a conclusion, that I won't be coming to my
computer (several times a day) and finding ingenious, or beautiful, or
hilarious stanzas from you.
</P>

<P>
For me this has been an amazing month and a half. I want to thank each
and every one who participated, whether you have a stanza visibly in
this poem or not. This morning, in reading East - West '99 again very
slowly, I consciously paused at each verse, at each new name, and
reflected on who had written it, the person, and the verse or verses he
or she sent to me, the notes, the questions, the comments having to do
with those stanzas. And then I bowed. It was a very wonderful
experience. I tell you this because I want you all to know that I honor,
and respect, and thank you individually as well as collectively.
</P>

<P>
All renku are like the tips of icebergs; we only see the verses accepted
or agreed upon. For every verse you read there are others that had to be
passed over for some reason or other. Many of the ones you don't see are
superb verses. In East - West '99, on the average, there were about ten
verses rejected for each one accepted (not including the two verses that
were exclusive: my wakiku, and Kiyoko Tokutomi's cherry blossom stanza,
#35). There were approximately 362 submissions in all. Forty-three poets
joined in the effort; twenty-seven have poems in the final copy.
Nineteen poets have one stanza included, seven poets have two, and one
ingenious soul somehow managed to muster three stanzas. The most
important thing I hope you realise about this is that, included or not,
every single verse helped make this poem what it is; all are very real
parts of the whole renku which, in itself, has much more to do with
process than product. Whether you submitted just one verse without
acceptance, or fifteen, or forty verses with a single acceptance, you
contributed time, energy, thought, and caring to a project that involved
people working together to achieve collaborative harmony.
</P>

<P>
Part of my feeling of gratitude is due to some wonderful new insights
that came to me as I struggled and laughed my way through the
construction of East - West '99. These insights have to do with the
meaning and purpose of renku, and with what it means to organize and
manage them. I doubt that I can put these visions into words adequately
right now, but I hope to. Briefly however, I'll say this: renku is
difficult, sometimes frustrating, and sometimes rewarding, but mostly
it's fun, and what a marvelous education! Each stanza in a renku has an
important purpose, and someone is appointed or selected to fullfill that
purpose. Every renku is a life. Born in a hokku, it develops through a
series of emotional experiences, reaches maturity and, in passing away,
is joyfully released into the realm of infinite possibility.

Note:   As part of our new haikai web journal,
The Heron's Nest (<A HREF="http://www.theheronsnest.com">www.theheronsnest.com</A>),
Alex Benedict and I plan to facilitate the writing of renku, and rengay, some
parts of which will be accomplished live, in the Yuki Teikei Society's
on-line chat room. We encourage you to visit The Heron's Nest, and to
sign-on for an identity in the chat room. There'll be discussions and
writing sessions and maybe even a contest or two. We hope you will stop
in to "see" us sometimes. And please consider sending some of your haiku
to The Heron's Nest.
