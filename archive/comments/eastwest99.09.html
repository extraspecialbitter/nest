Hello everyone,
</P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Good news! I&acute;ve chosen the ninth stanza! There&acute;s been a slew of submissions from which I chose four excellent candidates. I&acute;ve struggled mightily to make a selection from this group. A few flaws influenced this decision, but part of my dilemma was in determining which mood to move into. I'll begin with the runners up.
</P>

links by "scent" (utsuri: transference) meaning to carry on the preceding mood. It also provides the most radical shift of the verses received. I like this verse a lot. It&acute;s powerful, and although the shift is from humor to a wrenching slap of infidelity, there remains, nonetheless, a comedic element (we humans tend to find humor in one another&acute;s misfortunes). Due to this, in part, I opted to go with another verse. A near slapstick mood has already been set up, beginning with the "look-alikes" in the seventh verse, and continuing to the winking sisters in the following verse. A third stanza of rather bizarre humor would be too much. Even if this was not an issue, would we want to go towards such an overt betrayal at this point? Also, the syntax of the first line is nearly identical to that of the opening stanza. We must be careful not to repeat any elements found in the hokku.

creates a very interesting shift. Noting that the writer of this verse is a woman, we move from familial sisters to one of several possibilities, that the relationship is among sisters of the gay community. This is just one take. There are, of course, other perspectives. Otherwise, it&acute;s a quiet verse, both sensuous and searching. Here is a narrative, content link (kokoro-zuke) which works in two ways. One scenario depicts the erotic response to an overture made by the winking sister. Another depicts the protagonist&acute;s search of the sister&acute;s lifeline to see whether or not to pursue a relationship. This stanza is also very good. My decision to choose another is primarily based on the degree of passion, wanting it to be expressed more dynamically at this, the mid-point in a sequence of love verses. Also, I did some nit-picking. The "palm" is part of a hand. In verse six, the scarecrow is waving. This image of a scarecrow, taken literally, is just clothes flapping on poles, but the
personification presents it waving (with hands) at the sky-writer.

Ferris Gilli&acute;s

is superb. At this point I began to want to split the renku into two streams, emanating from both Ferris&acute; stanza and the one I ultimately chose. I find two links here, one very subtle, light and entertaining, one serious and questioning. On the light side, "waking slowly" makes it obvious that the person has been asleep, or perhaps this person was just "catching a couple of winks!" I don&acute;t know whether Ferris intended this wit, but there it is. The humor here is well submerged, so that it doesn&acute;t carry on a humorous narrative. On the contrary, this is a very sensuous and loving verse. The other linkage is narrative, having to do with tuning in to her mate. This woman knows that she is in competition with her sister. How has this affected her man? When asleep, or just waking, we are particularly vulnerable. Not only does the protagonist seem to cuddle more closely with her sleeping lover, she may be listening for steadiness in the beating of his heart, for telltale signs of
uncertainty, even infidelity.
</P>

<P>
And now the verse you&acute;ve been wondering about, my choice for the ninth stanza:
Kay Anderson&acute;s
</P>

<P>
his key in my lock<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turning<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me toward him
</P>

<P>
Here we have the highly erotic suggestion of a key in a lock, and the excruciating, single-word second line "turning," which evokes voluptuous slow motion. Yes, the passion is strong in this stanza. Taken as a whole, it is a narrative link to the uncertainty created by the two sisters (both wink with a single intention: to attract the same person). Which way will this person "turn?" Kay implies that she (as one of the sisters) takes the upper hand, that the man in question is turning towards her. But, taken literally, the man turns an actual key in an actual lock. This causes the woman to turn towards the sound. In this scenario, the woman, knowing she is in competition with her sister, wonders where her man has been. Why has he come home late, after she&acute;s locked the door? So, not only is there an obvious sexual overtone, and the implication that the man has made his decision between sisters, but the possible excitement and danger of a passionate confrontation. Perhaps the woman
has been waiting for her lover to return so she can confront him about his covert affair with her sister. At the sound of him, she turns to face the fire. As with the humor in Ferris&acute; stanza, the intimation of infidelity here is not obvious in the reading of the verse.
</P>

<P>
Bravo! So let&acute;s move on to verse #10. This verse can either continue the love theme, bringing it to some sense of conclusion, or it can simply have miscellaneous content and NO seasonal reference. It is a two-liner. It could take place outdoors, but I&acute;d prefer an inside verse. No gerunds (ing verb endings) please, and no first person pronouns. 2nd or 3rd person are fine as is a scene.
</P>

<P>
Thank you for all the wonderful work you&acute;re sending. I&acute;m happy to have decisions be so difficult.
