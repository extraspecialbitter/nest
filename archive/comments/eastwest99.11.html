Well folks,
</P>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next is our all day, on-line renku stanza fest! I'm very happy with our East - West '99 project thus far. I'm delighted so many fine verses have been sent, and at the same time, disappointed that many didn't make it onto the official sheet. I compliment all of you on your efforts.
</P>

<P>
Hopefully tomorrow's party will move along smoothly and all of you who can make it enjoy yourselves and find pleasure in seeing our sculpture take shape. Hopefully we'll be able to finish the whole thing by the ending time of 6:00 pm. If not, that's fine too; we'll continue via e-mail for as long as it takes.
</P>

<P>
I won't be sending any commentary with this most recent verse (#11) since I have out-of-town house guests right now. They'll be on their way at about the same time I'm logging into the Yuki Teikei chat room tomorrow. But I have selected a verse, by Cherie Hunter Day. Here it is:
</P>

<P>
hospital chapel<BR>
from the burnished paten she sneaks<BR>
a second host
</P>

<P>
I know, I asked you to move away from the realm of human affairs, and this verse does not, but I like the way it links to the wishbone, and shifts from the rather unusual and suggestive love sequence . . . straight into church (and hopefully the confessional as well). Yet the person we see now is so zealous that she simply must  whisk up TWO hosts.
</P>

<P>
Okay,
</P>

<P>
Please, stay away from humanity for #12 and #13 too. Stanza #12 should be a two-liner and a scene. No people. And let's go outside now. Bring your candidates to the party tomorrow and that's where we'll begin.
</P>
		<P>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See you Saturday, July 31 between 9:00 a.m. 6:00 p.m. (PDT) on-line.
</P>
