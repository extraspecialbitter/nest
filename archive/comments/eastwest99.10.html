Hello everyone,
</P>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Okay. Another difficult decision for the guy in the hot seat. And four more top
verses, each of which could take the renku into a new direction and feel. And
no, I'm not going to split this beast into four streams.
</P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Doris Thurston had yet another good link, this one of the narrative sort:
</P>

<P>
first light&#150;<BR>
their tangled pajamas
</P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This verse would wrap up the love sequence well. The ambiguity in Kay's verse
(our not knowing whether the man unlocking the door is welcome or not) would be
resolved. Doris points to a happy outcome, one in which the couple spends the
night making love and awakens in the resultant disorder. Unfortunately, there is
already an article of clothing in the renku, in verse three ( bedroom slippers).
Doris initially wrote of "yukata," lightweight cotton kimonos worn during the
summer season. Summer wouldn't work well at this stage in our poem, so I asked
her to make the change to pajamas, and she agreed. Then I noticed the clothing
repetition. If not for this glitch, Doris' stanza would have been a fine
addition.
</P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Francine Porad came up with an adroit shift from the circumstance at hand. She
took the position that no visitors were welcome at the time the man arrives in
Kay's verse. Francine's
</P>

<P>
phone off the hook<BR>
TV cop with answers
</P>

<P>
indicates (I know 'cause she told me) that when watching the news, or about to
hear answers to some puzzling point of interest, she does NOT want to be
disturbed, so, she takes the phone off the hook. But that doesn't work when
someone is coming into the room. Therefore the man's presence becomes an
annoyance.
</P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Jane Reichold submitted an excellent verse also, one that brings clarity to the
moment and adds intensity to an already intense scene.
</P>

<P>
cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo!<BR>
from the hallway clock
</P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The woman in Kay's verse is now be doubly startled, by the key in the lock and,
simultaneously, by the jarring sound of the cuckoo clock. From one view point
there seems to be something rather ominous about this moment, as if it
foreshadows an unpleasant situation. The cuckoo has a certain craziness about
it. Could the man be abusive? Could the woman be insanely jealous? However this
combination of verses hits you, whether implying danger, comic relief, or simply
startlement, the moment becomes much more vivid. This verse could work very
well, and my only reason for choosing someone else's is subjective, an
inclination to move into an alternative emotional territory.
</P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Alice Benedict's
</P>

<P>
left on the dining table<BR>
lucky end of the wishbone
</P>

<P>
is the verse, and the mood, I decided would become the tenth stanza. This
two-liner does so much! First of all, someone's wish comes true, and that wish
has something to do with the man's entrance (through Kay's verse) . . . turning
her toward him. The wish (for intimacy it seems) becomes reality, and, in the
excitement of the moment, the wishbone is left on the table. By the time we (the
readers) actually see the wishbone, it is probably already the next morning and,
through Alice's well-crafted, subtle implication, we have a pretty good idea of
what went on the night before. This stanza (as would Doris Thurston's "tangled
pajamas") gives a positive "turn" to the unfolding drama. We are now left wide
open to shift away from love, to a verse with no seasonal reference. I'm also
seeking to move away from human affairs in general for a bit, since people have
been dominant in the last four stanzas.
