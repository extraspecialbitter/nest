&#8220;These haiku are finely tuned because the poet is finely attuned.  
Ferris Gilli is extraordinarily sensitive to nuances in the world  
around her, recognizing them to be inseparable from what she feels  
inwardly. Through deft use of juxtaposition and exceptional language  
skills, Gilli invites us to experience her epiphanies for ourselves.&#8221;<br>

&#8220;We focus so often on a poet&#8217;s voice. Ferris Gilli has an even,  
considerate, and steady voice. But it&#8217;s her sense of listening that  
appeals most. These poems come alive in the interval between the  
senses that are stimulated directly by the poet&#8217;s images and the  
latent senses the reader is so warmly invited to apply. Gilli trusts  
her readers, as not all haiku poets are able to, and honors us  
through her faith.&#8221; <br>

&#8220;A luminous collection! Ferris Gilli hones each keenly perceived  
moment into sharp focus and conveys deeply felt connections with  
creatures, people, and things of her world. The craftsmanship is  
exemplary.&#8221; <br>
